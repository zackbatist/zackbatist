## Functional information objects

Used as tools that act on things, i.e. the hammer

## Intermediate information objects

Acted upon, ingested, input, i.e. the nail

## Reference objects

Neither acting on or acted upon, reference material, i.e. the ikea manual, checklist of things to do Relates to the notion that methods are documents.

## Knowledge objects

Not actually information objects, but important to distinguish due to similar terminology.
Not tangible things, more like an extended network of interconnected knowledge objects, which are packaged with other knowledge objects that can be dug down into (to uncover underlying assumptions; 'common knowledge' refers to these underlying assumptions that have been brought up to the surface) or extrapolated from to derive new or extended knowledge.
