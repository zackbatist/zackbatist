Databases are generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. While tech-savvy people typically limit their definition of a database to implementations of database management systems (DBMS) designed from a computationally-technical perspective, it is common for archaeologists to treat collections of discrete spreadsheets, which tend to be more user-friendly for less technical users, in ways that correspond with the definition provided above. Relational databases, which are commonly employed to manage archaeological data collected by a particular project, relate heterogeneous datasets by aligning them against mutual reference keys. Databases are also sometimes referred to as archives, typically when referring to the preservation of their contents for posterity. The term archive is also commonly used to refer to collections of physical records, which are often kept after being transcribed into digital formats."

It prioritizes emphasis on subjects’ outlooks, which are contextualized by their prior experiences. In this sense, situated cognition is closely related to Lave and Wenger’s theory of situated learning (also commonly referred to as a ‘communities of practice’ approach), which examines how individuals acquire professional skills in relation to their social environments (Lave and Wenger 1991). Situated cognition lends itself to investigating rather fluid, open-ended and affect-oriented actions, and is geared towards understanding how actors draw from their prior experiences to navigate through unique situations. It may be applied to examine how people who are learning new skills learn how to work in new ways relative to what they are used to. In such situations, situated cognition enables observers to examine how people align their perspectives as work progresses, and to better understand how people’s general outlooks may have changed with the guidance of more experienced mentors.\nLave and Wenger (1991) Suchman (2007)"

These databases impose string character limits for search strings, so we will be generating many small queries rather than lengthier strings that contain multiple keywords.

For Knorr-Cetina, knowledge objects are like well-organized drawers in a filing cabinet. In contrast, gaps in knowledge or unexpected behaviour are characterized as untidy and incomplete drawers that exist in an unresolved state. For Knorr-Cetina, science is an endeavour focusing on deriving a coherent understanding of the world, which involves the use of already established knowledge objects in the validation of newly arrived at ideas. However, my notion of knowledge differs from this in that it is not necessarily useful in a utilitarian sense. Instead, it refers to the ‘thick’ substrate that new knowledge must be compatible with. It is the context within which archaeological activities are undertaken, which inform and motivate them.\nLegitimate knowledge is grounded and recognized by methodological rigour (i.e. the appropriateness and integrity of methods and data, see below), and therefore differs from Latour and Woolgar’s (1986) characterization of “facts” as detached from the contexts from which they are derived."

Association with a domain also entails embodied experiences that are somewhat tangential to the actual practices that characterize the domain. Membership is expressed by adorning symbols, wearing certain styles of clothing, using certain styles of language and means of communication, association with certain domain-specific tools or objects in social or non-work contexts, or participation in shared memory or nostalgia. The expectation to perform membership in these ways has implications regarding the domains’ openness to diversity, since certain expressions used to signify belonging may be strongly associated with broader societal norms pertaining to particular subsets of the population, and those individuals would be able to enact these behaviours more easily or in ways that are deemed more genuine (Huggett 2004)."

    "title": "Overview",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Here are some ideas on how we task our ontology / conceptual model in our methodology.\n\nOverview\nAn ontology-based approach to qualitative data analysis, such as we advocate, calls for expressing the implied conceptualisation of a field (in our case, archaeological digital practice, including aspects of cognition and motivation of actors that shape action in the practice, as well as the role of diverse, both conceptual and physical/digital, mediating tools) in terms of a formal specification which will capture: (a) the main entities in the field at the level of granularity that captures our intuitions on how the field is structured, and (b) their properties and relationships (and their properties) that are relevant to our conception of the field. Relationships include ontological (mainly specialisation/generalisation, thorugh a class hierarchy, as well as mereological through a part-of hierarchy if relevant) and semantic ones related to the specifics of our field (e.g. Activity has_actor Actor, Document has_format Format). This formal representation should allow simple stuff (evidence presented in an interview, an archaeological activity described or observed) to be expressed simply, more complex stuff to be represented in an analogously more complex manner, and should allow us to pose useful questions and make useful inferences about the kinds of questions we are asking.\nWhile an ontology can be perfectly defined (in tools such as Protege) as a class hierarchy, and then semantic relationships are buried within properties in the property sheet of each class), most ontology builders will provide the important conceptual structures captured by the ontology in one or more \"top level\" diagrams. Examples are the \"activities as meetings between actors, objects, place and timespans\" diagram of CIDOC CRM, or the main structure and agency, procedure etc. perspective diagrams of Scholarly Ontology.\n\n\nUsing the model\nThe use of the model within E-CURATORS is twofold:\n\nIt is a starting point for defining the QDA code system, i.e. simple regular hierarchy (taxonomy) of terms (codes, in QDA parlance). Typically, the main entity class names (the ones that define will become top-level codes in the hierarchy, and then subclass names *as well as* types become subcodes). The challenge here is to capture at top level the significant facets from entities in the domain, and to capture also relationships (e.g. with goals and motives) that may be hidden way down in the specialisation hierarchy.\nIt is the reference model to construct a schema for the (graph) database that we want to create using Neo4J, to export and further process the coded-annotated data from MaxQDA. The main consideration for this is twofold:\n\nFirstly, what kind of expressiveness can we expect from the coded qualitative data, i.e. what kinds of relationships between, say, Actors, Activities etc. will be retrievable from the (multiple) codings of segments of data so that we can export them in an Excel spreadsheet and import them to generate automatically graph data within Neo4J? We can use complex code searches for this, e.g. find the (overlapping, identical, contiguous) segments that are coded both with a specific code (and its subcodes) and another code (and its subcodes) and surmise that the two are linked through a relationship in the conceptual model. Some experimentation with a coded paragraph of text, examining the resulting xls output, may be helpful to determine the possibilities. One idea is to define a \"container\" code, e.g. \"Context\", which we can use to highlight/code a continuous longer segment of text that refers to the same activity, or topic, in a participant's interview, and then seek to just create an output xls with codes from different code facets/hierarchies, e.g. actors (people and collectivities), activities, archaeological entities, tools etc. that belong to each such context, and then recreate separate graphs for each individual context by imputing relationships between entities postulated by our conceptual model.\nSecondly, what kinds of questions/queries we envisage interrogating the database with? These should be derived from our interest in substantive questions within E-CURATORS, on the structure of digitally-mediated / archaeology-related activities people engage with, on the identities motivations, and affiliations of people, on the goals stated for specific things they do, on the use of methods, routines, procedural knowledge etc. in accomplishing specific tasks, on the use and role of particular digital technologies, devices, tools, online infrastructures etc., on the problems and issues encountered by people, and the ways, ideas, approaches, solutions they are considering or employing in their activity, etc. But each dataset (from different E-CURATORS case study) may present us with further yet unanticipated dimensions. What we know already is more or less captured in texts already circulated within our workspace so far, and remains at a general, hopefully shared across cases, level, and a useful approach would be to scan ADS interviews and reverse-engineer a set of queries that are implicit in the material (i.e. questions that this evidence attends to), and, then, subset entities, relationships and properties from the conceptual model into Neo4J property lists/schemas for individual kinds of objects, which will then be used to convert MaxQDA outputs in .xls into graph database structures.\n\n\nSpecific comments and questions from the April 15, 2019 workshop\n\nPerhaps we don’t need SI Observable Entity — in general, much of that expansion of CIDOC CRM is relevant really to scientific instrumentation data processing which is rather irrelevant in our case (we may enocunter cases where people talk about capturing digital data, but will not process such data in our study).\nDo we need Creation and Assignment as subclasses of Activity? Activities can implicate objects in different relationships, and from our point of view it is important to differentiate between the relationship to a (direct) object and that to a means / tool that contributes to the activity, and for the \"input\" and \"output\" of an activity - so the Creation vs. Assignment subclasses differentiate between activities that point to an entire object (and one could think also of Destruction as a relevant complement to Creation) and those that modify an object through changing one or more of its properties (where apart from knowledge-related changes we should also consider physical modification of the Object as long as it retains its identity). The question is: do de need subclasses here, or would it be adequate to just note Activity types that would include Creation, Modification, Destruction etc.?\nWe need surely a specialisation of Activity for Assignments (Assertions) - to use the CRMinf notion. What people assert in general can be traced through kinds of Conceptual objects (e.g. Propositional Objects, Statements), the question of subclassing Activities (rather than just using Activity types) boils down to whether we need the additional properties to reconstitute what is assigned, the property it concerns etc.\nThe subclasses of Assignment, Argumentation, Belief adoption, Inference making, Evaluation, Simulation/prediction, Hypothesis building could be interesting and useful to be converted into QDA codes\n\nthe same things in SO are represented as Statements which are kinds of Conceptual objects; do we need to account for the activity of, say, evaluating, so that we recover in the Neo4J database the relationship of what is the thing that is evaluated, who evaluated it etc.? Or is it enough to just note evaluating as an activity type?\n\n\nNote: assuming that we seek to \"code\" kinds of activities such as evaluating, stating a hypothesis etc., we should consider how we could extract automatically the relationships of such an activity from QDA codings. One option would be to replicate in the code system (and codings) the kinds of conceptual objects that are the output of each the Argumentation subclasses, e.g. Evaluative statement, Hypothesis. Then we could create a query to find collocations between Argumentation (and subcodes) and Statement (and subcodes), and reconstitute the relationship in graphs within Neo4J.\nNote: Goals are kinds of statements, methods as kinds of conceptual objects - what they are *for the activity* is expressed as properties of the relationships\nMore specific decisions/considerations will emerge as we talk about the provisional code system we are building for Qualitative Data Analysis, have some experience using it, and consolidate decisions on it."

Schematizers set rules regarding how things should be done, framing subsequent work done by others.

Activities are understood as the relations between human subjects and the physical or conceptual tools or environments with or within which they act, and the motives or objectives that drive the system forward in a particular direction (Leont’ev 1974: 22-23). Activity theory is useful to examine how people mobilize a series of physical and conceptual tools to overcome the conditions that separate actors’ current states from their desired goals. In this sense, activity theory prioritizes the situated perspectives and experiences of human subjects while still trying to account for the agency that tools exhibit in their experiences as components of activity systems delegated towards addressing particular tasks. More specifically, activity theory helps to draw generalized accounts of practices employed in research projects. Documenting taken-for-granted aspects of work in a structured manner provides a unique window into how such practices contribute to broader disciplinary norms or professional mindsets. Recorded conversations and observations of enacted practices may be compared to determine how goals and strategies for achieving them are drawn up with the actual implementation of tasks. This contributes to understanding how certain challenges are perceived by involved stakeholders, how contingencies are accounted for, and how indicators of success may change as work progresses. Using activity theory effectively is not about describing the minute processes of enacted work, but rather about investigating how tasks and operations are strategically implemented as part of a coordinated effort to achieve broader goals.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEngeström, Y. 2000. “Activity Theory as a Framework for Analyzing and Redesigning Work.” Ergonomics 43 (7): 960–74. https://doi.org/10.1080/001401300409143.\n\n\nLeont’ev, A.

Mediating objects are considered as sites of negotiation, whose value may vary when incorporated into different sets of activities, according to the warrants, constraints and expectations that each activity entails.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nScholars typically argue that cultural interaction between the West Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Corsica and the European mainland took place through the Tuscan Archipelago, via such intermediary islands as Elba and Pianosa. This path is posited as the prime route in and out of these islands for both people and objects throughout prehistory largely due to the belief that early—pre-sail—seafarers would have wished to avoid more treacherous open-sea voyages. This article tests this hypothesis using social network analysis (SNA) to identify the strengths of inter-site relationships through time based on the relative proportions of West Mediterranean obsidian raw materials at 79 Neolithic sites dating from the sixth to fourth millennia BC. We argue that similar patterns of obsidian consumption reflect similar procurement mechanisms and the likelihood of more frequent interactions between the people of these communities. As such, it becomes possible to reconstruct the relationships that mediated the distribution of obsidian across the landscape. Contrary to previous interpretations highlighting the role of Elba and Pianosa in the exchange of obsidian from the geological sources of Sardinia along the coast to northern Italy and France, our results suggest that obsidian also took a more direct open-sea path upwards of 200 km from Corsica to the coastal regions of Provence and Languedoc in southern France. These results are contextualized within broader patterns of obsidian circulation and use and have important implications for debates surrounding Neolithic obsidian procurement, exchange spheres, and early maritime navigation.\n\n\n\n\nMap showing the frequencies of the total number of recovered artifacts at individual sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n BibTeX\n\n\n\n\n\n@article{freund2014,\ntitle = {Sardinian Obsidian Circulation and Early Maritime Navigation in the Neolithic as Shown Through Social Network Analysis},\nauthor = {Freund, Kyle P. and Batist, Zachary},\ndate = {2014-09-02},\njournaltitle = {The Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology},\nvolume = {9},\nnumber = {3},\npages = {364--380},\nissn = {1556-4894, 1556-1828},\ndoi = {10.1080/15564894.2014.881937},\nurl = {http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15564894.2014.881937},\nlangid = {english},\n}"

This prompted us to go back and remove records that are arguably out of scope. We identified a few dozen items that don’t really fit with our objective of assembling software made by archaeologists for archaeological purposes. Many of these are general-purpose tools that happen to be relevant to archaeological use-cases, and whose contributors and primary maintainers are largely, if not entirely, comprised of non-archaeologists (e.g. xraylib, QField). Others deal with specific processes that form parts of methods from other disciplines that archaeologists have come to work with and rely on, such as genetics, ecology and earth science, but which seem too distant from archaeology to warrant inclusion in open-archaeo.\nIt’s a bit jarring to make such a big update — especially one that removes around 15% of the dataset — so soon after we published a data paper about it. However, that paper was meant to communicate the data collection methods, the data structure, and the rationale, purpose and value that underlie open-archaeo and its continued development. We have always been very clear and upfront that this is a live project, but it’s still a bit awkward trying to align our work with more traditional forms of scholarly communication that are suited for more stable outcomes than what continuous and open-source projects afford.\nYou can see the changes in this git commit.

I’ve always been keen to present at this conference but somehow never really felt I had much important to say (aside from open-archaeo stuff, but Joe Roe and I already presented about it at the 2021 CAA conference, and more detailed analysis is still in the works). But this year Joe and I took the opportunity to co-lead a panel on archaeology and the fediverse based on our experiences administrating and moderating the archaeo-social mastodon instance. Our panel was meant to highlight key challenges and opportunities for collectively-owned and community-led scholarly social media, and while it only consisted of a few papers, it definitely got the ball rolling on further critical discussion regarding the role of the fediverse and decentralized communication protocols in online archaeological discourse. Joe and I are initiating work on a position paper that assembles the main ideas presented during the panel and subsequent discussion, so stay tuned for more on that. In the meantime, you can access our introductory remarks on zenodo and github.\nI also presented a paper on the challenges I experienced integrating and reusing data during my Master’s thesis, which I completed 8 years ago, basically summarizing its failures (trying to channel Shawn Graham’s Failing Gloriously). This basically served as a venue for finally presenting my long-held yet unpublished uncertainties about the value of analyses that integrate legacy data, drawn from my personal experiences.\nI really appreciated how low-key and relaxing the conference was. It was great to just have a casual experience with a relatively small group of like-minded researchers. I was very fortunate to be able to travel to Turin and participate in person. I also went on a nice post-conference excursion to Genoa, which is a truly lovely city.

    "text": "A substack post about peer review is getting a lot of attention, and I’m here to rant about it. Basically the post is calling out the peer review process as a terrible and broken system. And it is. But the author’s rhetoric about it is kind of problematic.\n1. Peer review is not an experiment.\nThe author claims that it is, but contradicts himself straight away:\n\nThe experimental design wasn’t great; there was no randomization and no control group. Nobody was in charge, exactly, and nobody was really taking consistent measurements. And yet it was the most massive experiment ever run, and it included every scientist on Earth.\n\nThese are not just things that make an experiment bad, they are things that preclude peer review from being an experiment altogether. Experiments are run on samples, they are run with intent, they are performed in controlled environments. As someone who calls himself an experimental psychologist and who calls his blog “experimental history”, he really extends the term experiment in weird ways. This use of the term is like referring to the “experiment of democracy”, basically just grand rhetoric for “we’re figuring things out and learning as we go”.\nThe author also seems to think of the experiment of peer review as a pass/fail test, which again, is not what experiments are for. He sets bars for what successful scientific evaluation ought to look like, and measures his experiences of peer review against it. But this is not an experiment, this is qualitative assessment. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it’s troubling how the author wraps his proclamation that peer review is bad and should be abolished within some phony hearkening to science-core.\n2. General discourse is not enough to validate truth statements.\nVarious parts of the post indicate that the author considers science to be the evaluation of statements of truth, which can only be verified by their fidelity to observed reality. Ok, fair enough. But he refers to Einstein’s large body of non-reviewed work as an argument for relying on discourse among educated fellows as an efficient way of evaluating the quality of scientific work. Despite Einstein’s apparent genius, which is cemented in popular imagination but who also happened to be wrong about some things, this is not reason enough to abolish peer review. Moreover, the author does not consider the general acceptance of non-reviewed ideas that happened to be wrong as a counter point that clearly refutes his main point.\n3. What about non-experimental methods?\nThe author has a huge blind spot for non-experimental methods. He suggests that if the results of a scientific analysis can be replicated, then that is good enough for acceptance into an authoritative cannon of truth. Moreover, he indicates that work that can not replicate is “a whole lotta money for nothing”, basically a waste of time and resources. But a lot of science can not be replicated, by virtue of the fact that science doesn’t always follow experimental protocols that allow for replication tests to be performed. Fantastic and valuable work that relies on non-experimental heuristics, including a lot of work in the social sciences and humanities, climate science, ecology, astronomy and various other fields, are left in the lurch. His take on non-replicability in these disciplines reads a lot like the unethical and ironically non-replicable Sokal hoaxes that serve as the basis for unhinged right-wing attacks on the social sciences and humanities.\nThis also contradicts the author’s hearkening to discourse among learned men of olde as a way of dealing with problems relating to peer review. Opening up the comments section, even if just limited to a curated list of credentialed scholars, is not the same as conducting independent replication studies. I think the reasoning behind this link is that if other people have experienced similar phenomena in their own labs, then it’s more likely to be accepted as true. But this is not the same as replication under the same conditions, it is just the same uncontrolled consensus-based evaluation criteria as peer review but with an open filter.\n4. Peer-review in context\nI agree with many of the things that the author is saying. Yes, there are many ways in which peer review is broken and could be improved. For instance, I agree with the notion that peer reviewers do not dive deep enough into the data and aren’t always critical enough. But I think that this is because most people are unprepared to do so, either because they do not have access to data or do not know how to work with statistics or read code. Moreover, certain journals like PNAS give preferential treatment to certain authors over others, and there are definitely major issues with racism and sexism in the evaluation process. Open peer review does not resolve these issues, namely because it treats peer review in isolation.\nThe only way to make peer review better is by instilling good scholarly practices in the next generation of scholars. However, this is inhibited by structural issues, such as the tight job market that favours quantity of peer reviewed articles over any other factor, and the general prestige economy of academia. These are the root issues. The foul state of peer review is one aspect of this mess, alongside structural racism, sexism and transphobia, the sheer expense of obtaining an advanced degree and excelling in the years immediately post-PhD, and the pressures to conform trends that get you funding. You can not separate the problems with peer review from these issues. Yet somehow the author manages to completely side step these concerns, identifying the broken peer review system as a purely epistemic problem, rather than a problem with tangible and far-reaching social implications."

    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s a weird time to be starting a blog. Twitter has imploded and many of my colleagues have started using mastodon instead. There’s a lot of talk about the virtues of decentralization and of establishing and maintaining firm community values as reflected in content moderation policies and practices. Of course, all of this discourse is happening in microblog format, and is restricted by the usual inability to have any kind of nuanced conversation on the web. I feel that when posting on twitter and on mastodon alike, I’m bound to a formal position, and I find it hard to establish a tone that is my own. This makes it difficult for me to be casual, and to express my thoughts in a way that makes sense to me, especially when my ideas are really half-baked or vaguely critical. So I started this blog to help me retain a more tentative voice that I often express in casual conversations, and which I’m terrified of letting out in more formal or professional spaces.\nThe shift to mastodon has been interesting. It definitely has a very different vibe, but there’s a chance that this might just be due to the novelty of the experience. Sure, there are affordances built in to the platform that enable or encourage certain behaviours, such as content warnings, image descriptions and various means of controlling post visibility, but the value of these features will depend on whether people take action and actually use them.\nI think that the biggest change, whose ramifications we’re just starting to see, has to do with community governance. On twitter, the usual and pretty much only way of responding to inadequate content moderation was to complain and put up with it. But on mastodon there are three main ways you can deal with it:\n\nput up with it,\nswitch to another instance, or\nget involved, give feedback, make change\n\nPeople are very used to the first option, and the latter two require more work. The second option involves a bit of work to find another instance that appeals to you, to create a new introduction post and build out your profile again, and to re-link all your other socials, etc. The third option seems like the most exciting one, since it actually feels like a potential venue for dynamic community building, for personal and collective growth. The distinction between the second and third options may also have lot to do with a weird tension between techno-libertarian and anarcho-syndicalist visions of (web-based) community building (but more on that in another post…).\nThis is the sort of thing that is on my mind as archaeo.social continues to develop. Joe Roe started archaeo.social as a mastodon instance for archaeologists, and I joined him soon after to help with content moderation and to plan some community guidelines (still in progress). I’m learning a lot through this whole experience. I’m learning to be more patient, more open to other perspectives, less controlling, and less apprehensive. It’s still early days, and Joe is encouraging me to sit tight, let the community do its thing, get them to shape the path ahead, which scares the hell out of me. Hours before archaeo.social launched, I even posted a very critical toot about how this would be bound to fail, but look at me now, riding shotgun!\n\n\n\nMe being wrong on the internet, hopefully.\n\n\nIn retrospect, that kind of attitude I posted a couple weeks ago may be what’s holding us back. We need to try things out and play around to find out what else could come from all of this. I’m very eager to have been wrong."

    "text": "Today I submitted an abstract to present at the DAB23 colloquium hosted by the Bern Computational and Digital Archaeology lab. The conference is about “advancing open research into the next decade” and my paper is titled Documenting the collaborative commitments that support data sharing within archaeological project collectives. Here is the abstract:\n\nArchaeological research is inherently collaborative, in that it involves many people coming together to examine a material assemblage of mutual interest by implementing a variety of tools and methods in tandem. Independent projects establish organizational structures and information systems to help coordinate labour and pool information derived thereof into a communal data stream, which can then be applied towards the production and publication of analytical findings. Albeit not necessarily egalitarian, and with different expectations set for people assigned different roles, archaeological projects thus constitute a form of commons, whereby participants contribute to and obtain value from a collective endeavour. Adopting open research practices, including sharing data beyond a project’s original scope, involves altering the collaborative commitments that bind work together. This paper, drawn from my doctoral dissertation, examines how archaeologists are presently navigating this juncture between established professional norms and expectations on the one hand, and the potential benefits and limitations afforded by open research on the other.\nI applied an abductive qualitative data analysis approach based on recorded observations, interviews, and documents collected from three cases, including two independent archaeological projects and one regional data sharing consortium with limited scope and targeted research objectives. My analysis documents a few underappreciated aspects of archaeological projects’ sociotechnical arrangements that open data infrastructures should account for more thoroughly:\n\nboundaries, whether they restrict membership within a collective, delimit a project’s scope, or limit the time frame under which a project operates, have practical positive value, and are not just arbitrary impediments;\nsystems designed to direct the flow of information do so via the coordination of labour, and the strategic arrangement of human and object agency, as well as resistances against such managerial control, are rarely accounted for in data documentation; and\ninformation systems and the institutional structures that support them tend to reinforce and reify existing power structures and divisions of labour, including implicit rules that govern ownership and control over research materials and that designate who may benefit from their use.\n\nBy framing data sharing, whether it occurs between close colleagues or as mediated by open data platforms among strangers, as comprising a series of collaborative commitments, my work highlights the broader social contexts within which we develop open archaeological research infrastructures. As we move forward, we should be aware of and account for how the data governance models embedded within open research infrastructures either complement or challenge existing social dynamics."

    "title": "Some thoughts on data formality",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m using this post to draw out some thoughts that I feel are coherent in my mind but I struggle to communicate in writing. The general topic is the notion of formality, and how it is expressed in data work and data records.\nIn a management sense, formality involves adhering to standard protocol. It involves checking all the boxes, sticking to the book, and ensuring that behaviour conforms to institutional expectations. In this way, bureaucracy is the essence of formality. By extension, formality is a means through which power is expressed, in that it binds interactions to a certain set of acceptable possibilities. In effect, formality renders individual actions in subservience to a broader system of control.\nBut formality is also useful. Formality reduces friction involved in transforming and transmitting information across contexts. Any application that implements a formal standard can access and transmit information according to the standard, which reduces cognitive overhead on the part of actors responsible for processing information. They relocate creative agency upstream, towards managers of data and of labour, who make decisions regarding how other actors (human and non-human actors alike) may interact with the system before they ever occur. This basically manifests itself in workflows, which are essentially disciplined ways of working directed towards targeted outcomes (I wrote about workflows in a 2021 paper and in my dissertation, which draws from Bill Caraher’s contribution to Critical Archaeology in the Digital Age, among other work he’s written on the topic). To be clear, I do not mean to imply that adopting workflows constitutes a negative act. An independent scholar may apply a workflow to help achieve their goals more effectively and efficiently, and empowers them to get the most out of the resources at their disposal. However, one of the key findings from my dissertation is that when applied in collective enterprises, they tend to genericize labour and data for the purpose of extraction and appropriation, which is understood to be an ordinary aspect of archaeological research, as is evident by how actors performing genericized labour internalize this as part of their work role.\nDeveloping a workflow essentially entails adopting and enforcing protocols and formats, which are series of documented norms and expectations that ensure that information may be made interchangeable. Protocols are standards that dictate means of direct communication, and formats are standards that dictate how should be stored. Forms are interfaces through which information is translated from real-world experiences into standardized formats.\nFormal data are information whose variables and values are arranged according to a formally-defined schema. A formal dataset comprises a series of records collated in a consistent manner, motivated by a need, desire or warrant to render them comparable. The formally-defined schema makes this potential for comparison much easier. A common means of representing formal data is through tables, which are comprised of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column a variable that describes a facet of each record. The values recorded for each variable constitute observations or descriptive characterizations pertaining to the object of each record. One can therefore determine what kinds of structured observations were made about a recorded object by finding the values located at the intersection of records and variables (i.e., individual cells in a table). Each record relates to a set of variables applied to the whole set and documented in the schema.\nIn its most extreme, formality entails a realm of total control, where all information is collected and processed according to an all-encompassing model of the world. It is not coincidental that models are the primary outlooks through which both managers and computer systems engage with the world. It has been the dream of bureaucrats and computer scientists alike to develop such systems (see the work of Paul Otlet, Vanevar Bush, and the weirdly techno-libertarian crowd associated with structured note-taking and personal knowledge management). Nor is it a coincidence that formality is a requisite aspect of both bureaucracies and computers. Computational environments and bureaucracies both effectively capture and maintain institutional power dynamics.\nIn some cases, such as with text boxes, the variable may be precisely defined by the values are left open-ended. However, users are still expected to provide certain kinds of information in these fields (I remember at a conference in 2019, Isto Huvila (whose work on archaeological records management is also a great source of inspiration) referred to these as “white boxes”, which conveys their literal appearance and is a clever and ironic play on words referring to the notion of “black boxes” that hide the intricate details of a process behind an opaque connotative entity). In this sense, the standards are thus mediated by social and professional norms, but exist nonetheless. This reflects the fact that social and professional norms, standards, and expectations will never go away, they are fundamental aspects of communication and participation within communities.\nThe million dollar question nowadays (at least in my own mind) is how can we create information infrastructures that strike a balance between the need to transmit information succinctly between computers via the web, and the capability to share context and subtext whose significance originate in the gaps between recorded information and which gain meaning only in relation to the shared experience of communicating agents as members of a social or professional community?"

    "text": "Last week I travelled to Switzerland to participate in Digital Archaeology Bern (2023). The conference was themed “advancing open research into the next decade” and served as a way to take stock of developments since the 2012 World Archaeology Special Issue on Open Archaeology and Ben Marwick’s influential 2017 paper Computational Reproducibility in Archaeological Research, which came out 10 and 5 years ago, respectively. I think that the conference was a remarkable success, and all 50-60 participants were actively engaged in critical discussions on what it means to do open archaeology. You can find my slides and presentation notes on GitHub (https://github.com/zackbatist/DAB23).\nAlthough there were some elements of this, the conference was not just superficial open-boosting. Most, if not, all participants highlighted challenges and unanticipated implications of being open that they have recently experienced. Looking back, a few themes stood out:\n\nThinking about value proposition that openness entails, which necessarily involves accounting for specific use cases and imagined future stakeholders.\nThinking about the needs and values of all stakeholders involved in doing archaeology, including local and Indigenous communities, land-owners, archivists, government agencies, and related parties, and what openness means for them.\nThinking about how we might reconcile our values as archaeologists with the values demanded and afforded by the infrastructures and communities with whom we must work.\n\nI got to meet so many interesting people. I already knew many of them from social media, virtually-hosted talks, or brief in-person interactions at the CAA back in 2018, and it was really great to put a face to each person’s name. Most serious work in digital archaeology, especially productive work developing open data infrastructures, is being done in Europe, and I was very grateful to have this opportunity to connect with that crowd (especially since I’m currently entering the post-PhD academic job market). I think my paper was well-received and valued, and it opened the door to many interesting discussions during the breaks between sessions and elsewhere.\nI was also able to tack on a couple days at the start to work with Joe Roe on an article we’ve been writing for the better part of 3 years, about collaborative aspects of open source software development among archaeologists. We presented a paper at the 2021 CAA conference on the composition of open-archaeo, the list of open source software and resources made by and for archaeology that I maintain, and we’re trying to expand on it a little bit more with some network analysis type stuff. So this time together really gave us an opportunity to discuss what we really want out of the paper, to actually talk through the results, and generally helped motivate us to get this done. We still have some work cut out for us, but that probably warrants its own blog post.\nAnyway, here are some cool pictures from the trip!\n\n\n\nView of the street from my hostel\n\n\n\n\n\nLithics on display at the Laténium\n\n\n\n\n\nSome stuff I saw when I got lost one morning\n\n\n\n\n\nView of the city from a perch near the university"

    "text": "The first peer-reviewed paper deriving from my dissertation is finally published in Open Archaeology! It showcases qualitative research on scholarly communication within archaeological projects — specifically the role of informal communication styles in archaeological knowledge production, and how they complement more formally structured documentary media.\nOn the Value of Informal Communication in Archaeological Data Work\nhttps://doi.org/10.1515/opar-2024-0014\nArchaeological data simultaneously serve as formal documentary evidence that supports and legitimizes chains of analytical inference and as communicative media that bind together scholarly activities distributed across time, place, and social circumstance. This contributes to a sense of “epistemic anxiety,” whereby archaeologists require that data be objective and decisive to support computational analysis but also intuitively understand data to be subjective and situated based on their own experiences as participants in an archaeological community of practice. In this article, I present observations of and elicitations about archaeological practices relating to the constitution and transformation of data in three cases in order to articulate this tension and document how archaeologists cope with it. I found that archaeologists rely on a wide variety of situated representations of archaeological experiences – which are either not recorded at all or occupy entirely separate and unpublished data streams – to make sense of more formal records. This undervalued information is crucial for ensuring that relatively local, bounded, and private collaborative ties may be extended beyond the scope of a project and, therefore, should be given more attention as we continue to develop open data infrastructures."

The author reverts back to a plain and simple citation count in his analysis of gender disparities, and misses a great opportunity to draw upon centrality measurements as a key indicator of inequitable aspects of professional development across the genders.\nThe author also annotated the graphs with diagrams that look kind of like a compass rose.

    "text": "Framing of science and non-science\nThis paper perpetuates an outdated dichotomy between science and the arts and humanities. It never really defined either of these things, or attempts to reconcile the terms used by the citations databases against their own notion of what science and arts and humanities means to them. But these terms appear in the compass roses and in their descriptions of the graph visualizations as if their meanings are self-evident.\nAlso very interesting is they say a lot about science but not much about arts and humanities. In fact, it may be more apt to say that this paper describes science and non-science, rather than some alternative other cohesive entity. The author describe journals, topics and methods that they identify as scientific, but do not do this at all for entities that they relate to as belonging to the arts and humanities. The lack of distinction between these terms reveals a lack of willingness to treat the things they represent as things in themselves rather than a lack of something, namely, science.\nThe paper also relies on really outdated visions of the character of various disciplines and of archaeology specifically. As far as I can tell, it relies on two sources:\n\nPantin, C.F.A. 1968 The Relations Between the Sciences, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press\nBecher, T. and Trowler, P.R. 2001 Academic Tribes and Territories, 2nd Edition, Maidenhead: Society for Research into Higher Education/Open University Press.\n\nBecher is extremely outdated and falls within a period when scientists (especially social scientists, including Binford) were aching to make their disciplines seem more scientific. So there is a strange value judgement at play, and they often failed to capture the reality of how science actually works. The other source is mentioned only very briefly in passing, but follows a similar essentialist rhetoric regarding the fundamental nature of specific disciplines, which rubs me the wrong way. A lot of excellent work that examines the pragmatic reality of scientific practice, which highlights contradictions and misrepresentations, and that presents the fluidity across disciplines rather than hard distinctions, is simply ignored (e.g. Latour and Woolgar’s Laboratory Life, Latour’s Pandora’s Hope, Knorr-Cetina’s Epistemic Cultures, Bowker’s Science on the Run, to name just a few)."

Citation networks depict clusters of citations, but the jump to making these clusters meaningful in relation to some broader social or epistemic phenomenon is never really articulated. Moreover, the author indicates they he applied the Girvan-Newman method for identifying clusters, but doesn’t really incorporate the means through which this algorithm operates, including its limitations, into the analysis. Clusters do not simply exist, they are highlighted through some method, which impacts what we see.\nAfter writing an initial draft I found that the author has done other relevant scientometric work with a more targeted scope:\n\nSinclair, A. (2020). From Specialty to Specialist: a citation analysis of Evolutionary Anthropology, Palaeolithic Archaeology and the Work of John Gowlett 1970-2018. In J. Cole, J. McNabb, M. Grove, & R. Hosfield (Eds.), Landscapes of Evolution: Studies in Honour of John Gowlett (pp. 175-201). Oxford: Archaeopress.\n\nAlthough I do not have access to this paper, it is likely to be much more effective since these kinds of analyses tend to work better when a more specific objective is outlined, since it’s easier to ground the relationships within a specific set of experiences, rather than relying too much on generalizations and abstractions."

The author frames the diverse array of terminology as a problem that needs to be overcome, rather than a very interesting aspect of archaeological research practice with its own benefits and affordances. Standards implemented in harder sciences are stated as goals worth attaining, but I’m left unconvinced that this is really worth doing based on the findings presented here."

I relate these observations to issues experienced when sharing data globally on the web using open data platforms. This is part of an effort to reorient data sharing (and other aspects of open science) as a social, collaborative, communicative, and commensal experience.\nMany thanks to my supervisor, Costis Dallas, for being such a great mentor, and to Matt Ratto and Ted Banning for their constant constructive feedback. And special thanks to the external examiners, Jeremy Huggett and Ed Swenson, for critically engaging with my work.\nArchaeological data work as continuous and collaborative practice\nThis dissertation critically examines the sociotechnical structures that archaeologists rely on to coordinate their research and manage their data. I frame data as discursive media that communicate archaeological encounters, which enable archaeologists to form productive collaboration relationships. All archaeological activities involve data work, as archaeologists simultaneously account for the decisions and circumstances that framed the information they rely on to perform their own practices, while anticipating how their information outputs will be used by others in the future. All archaeological activities are therefore loci of practical epistemic convergence, where meanings are negotiated in relation to communally-held objectives.\nThrough observations of and interviews with archaeologists at work, and analysis of the documents they produce, I articulate how data sharing relates distributed work experiences as part of a continuum of practice. I highlight the assumptions and value regimes that underlie the social and technical structures that support productive archaeological work, and draw attention to the inseparable relationship between the management of labour and data. I also relate this discursive view of data sharing to the open data movement, and suggest that it is necessary to develop new collaborative commitments pertaining to data publication and reuse that are more in line with disciplinary norms, expectations, and value regimes."

    "text": "I’m happy to announce that Joe Roe and I just published a paper in Internet Archaeology that explores collaborative practices in archaeological open source software development. This paper has been in development for a while, and we’re glad to finally release our work.\n\nVersion of record: https://doi.org/10.11141/ia.67.13\nPostprint: https://zackbatist.info/openarchaeo-collaboration\nResearch compendium: https://github.com/zackbatist/openarchaeo-collaboration\nZenodo archive: https://zenodo.org/records/12752060\n\nTo briefly summarize: we investigated the under-explored practices involved in research software engineering in archaeology, with an emphasis on collaborative experiences involved in open source software development. We identified not only what kinds of software archaeologists are making, but how archaeologists create these tools as part of a broader community of practice. We conducted exploratory data analysis and network analysis on data from open-archaeo, supplemented with additional data pulled from the GitHub API, to trace how archaeologists use various languages, forges, licenses and supporting features (e.g. issues, stars, pull requests), and to discern trends regarding projects’ longevity, degree of community participation, and overall structure of collaborative ties.\nOpen archaeology, open source? Collaborative practices in an emerging community of archaeological software engineers\nSurveying the first quarter-century of computer applications in archaeology, Scollar (1999) lamented that the field relied almost exclusively on “hand-me-down” tools repurposed from other disciplines. Twenty five years later, this is no longer the case: computational archaeologists often find themselves practicing the dual roles of data analyst and research software engineer (Baxter et al. 2012; Schmidt and Marwick 2020), developing and applying new tools that are tailored specifically to archaeological problems and archaeological methods. Though this trend can be traced to the very earliest days of the field (Cowgill 1967), its most recent manifestation is distinguished by its apparent embrace of practices from free and open source software. Most prominently, since around 2015, there has been a rapid uptake of workflow tools designed for open source development communities, such as the version control system git and associated online source code management platforms (e.g. GitHub, GitLab). These tools facilitate collaboration among developers and users of open source software using patterns that can diverge quite radically from conventional scholarly norms (Tennant et al. 2020).\nIn this paper, we investigate modes of collaboration in this emerging community of practice using ‘open-archaeo’, a curated list of archaeological software, and data on the activity of associated GitHub repositories and users. We conduct an exploratory quantitative analysis to characterize the nature and intensity of these collaborations and map the collaborative networks that emerge from them. We document uneven adoption of open source collaborative practices beyond the basic use of git as a version control system and GitHub to host source code. Most projects do make use of collaborative features and, through shared contributions, we can can trace a collaborative network that includes the majority of archaeologists active on GitHub. However, a majority of repositories have 1–3 contributors, with only a few projects distinguished by an active and diverse developer base. Direct collaboration on code or other repository content—as opposed to the more passive, social media-style interaction that GitHub supports—remains very limited. In other words, there is little evidence that archaeologists’ adoption of open source tools (git and GitHub) has been accompanied by the decentralized, participatory forms of collaboration that characterise other open source communities. On the contrary, our results indicate that research software engineering in archaeology remains largely embedded in conventional professional norms and organizational structures of academia."

    "text": "So I think I finally understand LaTeX. Of course there’s still a lot for me to learn, but I think I’m at a point where I am really harnessing its true value.\nI’ve been working with plaintext since I started writing my dissertation. Until very recently my workflow closely resembled an RMarkdown setup, and largely corresponded with this guide written by Ben Marwick. My simple understanding is that Pandoc passes the Markdown through LaTeX to produce a viable PDF, which makes it possible to scatter LaTeX throughout the content and in the YAML front matter. So I had a mish-mash of both Markdown and LaTeX conventions in most of my documents. For instance, I was using the comprehensive graphicx package to render my figures and I was referring to endnotes stored in a separate tex file using the sepfootnotes package, all while using Pandoc’s citeproc bibliographic referencing system. Eventually I came to realize that my workflow was fundamentally built upon LaTeX, or comprises functions that closely correlate with common LaTeX macros.\nI worked using this hybrid Markdown/LaTeX setup for years, until last week when I was prompted by a member of my supervisory committee to compile a unified document so he could better understand the flow of my thesis. I had anticipated that I would need to convert everything to pure LaTeX at some point, and it was as good a time as any.\nPreviously, I had mashed together code from various Stack Overflow posts in order to generate something functional, but it’s a completely different experience when you start from scratch. I started by following the Overleaf guide on how to structure a thesis using LaTeX, and now I have a very robust and elegant setup that compiles a single, tidy, and systematic PDF from multiple sources.

I really struggled to differentiate between the various packages for bibliographic formatting, footnotes, figures and floats and their cross-compatibility. Some packages seem to be developed according to common tendencies, sort of like the R Tidyverse (in the sense of holding a generally common syntax, not in terms of cult behaviour), based around central cores such as biblatex and hyperref.\nI’ve also been using LaTeX to format my CV, and today I started using it to create slides for an upcoming conference presentation. I like how programmatic the CV feels — you script a macro once, call the function along with the text you want it to parse, and you got a pretty little table of all your career accomplishments! I’m still kind of undecided about using beamer for conference slides, but I do like how it encourages me to write concurrently as I create the slides."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In an early draft of one of my dissertation’s background chapters I wrote a ranty section about notions of data held by the open science movement that I find really annoying. I eventually excised this bit of text, and while it isn’t really worth assembling into any publication, I thought it may still be worth sharing here. So here is a lightly adapted version, original circa May 2022.\nThe past decade has seen a major push to develop information infrastructures, or “set[s] of organizational practices, technical infrastructure, and social norms that collectively provide for the smooth operation of scientific work at a distance” (Bowker et al. 2010: 102), that are specifically oriented towards facilitating data sharing and reuse among archaeologists. These efforts frequently identify as participating within the open access (OA) movement, which is a distributed grassroots campaign that encourages greater accessibility of scientific research outputs. The OA movement is in turn inspired by the free and open source software (FOSS) movement, whose goals are to ensure that anyone can run, study, modify and share software without restriction, but which is more popularly identified with collective and non-commercial software development processes guided by the aforementioned principles rather than by a pursuit of profit (Kelty 2008: 254-255; Costa 2013: 449-450). While the OA and FOSS movements are distinct in that OA largely deals with scientific practices and the outcomes of scientific research while FOSS is concerned with software development, they share common concern with inclusive, transparent and collective integration of knowledge and labour. These principles that inform both the OA and FOSS movements are indeed commendable, however the ways that they tend to envisage science and scientific knowledge production warrant critical reflection. Here I identify some concerning issues that have been incorporated into the open data infrastructures that archaeologists have begun to adopt, and which contribute to a problematic and counter-intuitive conception of archaeological data and of archaeological knowledge production in general.\nData are the material records that archaeologists produce to store, transmit and communicate meaning. They are functional in nature, meaning they are tools that archaeologists rely on to extend their understanding of phenomena of interest. In other words, data work alongside analytical methods so that archaeologists can get from one point of understanding to another. Data are produced and used through pragmatic action and necessity, and exhibit characteristics that derive from the circumstances of their creation and their intended purposes. This notion that data are the products of social and material decisions is widely accepted by scholars of scientific practice, but many academics who generate and make use of data in their day-to-day work, including archaeologists, still commonly consider data as disembodied statements about the world as it truly is and which inform more elaborate and complex ways of understanding particular phenomena (Kintigh et al. 2015: 2). This aligns with a popularly held view of science as the collective pursuit of a unified and unambiguous understanding of nature. This general vision of science considers knowledge to accumulate on a grand, global scale, and is thought to inform technological change in a way that reflects arbitrarily defined technological scales of progress. For instance, early hominins’ ability to craft stone tools is thought to have been necessary for the development of iron production, which necessarily informed the invention of steel, and eventually led humans to create electronic computers, and so on into an imagined future that conspicuously resembles the future worlds depicted by a particular cohort of post-war science fiction writers (i.e. Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, H.G. Wells’ World Brain, Isaac Asimov’s Foundation trilogy, Gene Roddenberry’s Star Trek, etc).\nInterestingly enough, many non-archaeologist adherents to this ideology rely on outmoded archaeological frameworks that have been discredited for decades, namely grand and deterministic histories of scientific and technological progression. They use their limited understanding of archaeology to identify “technologies out of place”, or artefacts that do not fit in with the just-so technological narratives summarized above. Things like the Antikythera mechanism, the Babylon battery, and the archaeological site of Gobleki Tepe are sources of fervent discussion that often feeds into colonial and racist pseudoarchaeological tropes regarding “lost civilizations” that seeded the remnants of their knowledge to the ancestors of indigenous peoples.\nThe accumulation and assembly of data is thought to contribute to a species-level understanding of the world, which is not held by any one individual but is stored in media such as books, scientific reports, and internet-connected archives (cf. Bush 1945). These documents are perceived of as value-neutral and purely representational in nature, and are thought to be produced and maintained by scholars and librarians exhibiting the virtuous traits of scientific objectivity, openness to alternative perspectives, and the capability to critique ideas in a rational and structured manner (cf. Ettarh 2018).\nThis idealized vision of science is commonly illustrated through the data/information/knowledge/wisdom (DIKW) pyramid, which relates basic and synthetic ways of understanding the world. More specifically, the DIKW model states that representations of a natural truth (data) undergird more complex statements (information) which inform explanations (knowledge) and eventually contribute to intrinsic understanding (wisdom). Despite the implication of movement from one stage to the next, this model fails to account for how these transitions actually occur in practice. Moreover, the flow is assumed to be unidirectional up the pyramid towards a pinnacle of pure human thought. This resembles another popular metaphor in knowledge management, that of the oil pipeline, whereby data are presented as scarce natural resources that are harvested and gradually refined to create more stable and marketable products. Mining for data is characterized as visceral and material work that occurs close to nature, while refining and synthesizing are imagined as more mental and formulaic processes. Like the DIKW scheme, the pipeline model assumes that the starting point is a natural and free-flowing repository of truth, and that researchers must contain and channel it to give it greater value, while giving it artificial shape in the process (Huggett 2020: S8-S9; Dallas 2015: 194). Any sources of friction that impede the flow of data are considered as obstructions that must be cleared or worked around to facilitate the development of more elaborate forms of understanding (Huggett 2022: 284). At the same time, the systems engineered to channel information are meant to protect us, to ensure that we do not get swept away by the “data deluge”, unmoored and lost at sea (cf. Bevan 2015).\nThis drives an obsessive concern with workflows pertaining to legal and logistical issues surrounding scientific publishing that OA advocates deem problematic. Many OA advocates see publishing as the business of typesetting and copyright law, which they could render moot using automated publishing workflows and by encouraging use of open licensing agreements (cf. Foster and Deardorff 2017; Harnad 1998). Viewed as merely technical systems, these could be resolved through technical means. However academic publishing and ownership involve social arrangements that serve to stabilize knowledge, grant authority to validated claims, and enable science to move forward (Kelty 2008: 274-275). In other words, technocentric visions of publication workflows tend to ignore the fact that publication is a cultural phenomenon, whereby projects are made complete and knowledge claims are articulated, credited, and rendered accountable to the people who proposed them.\nThe technocratic system imagined by OA advocates envisions a global web of information, whereby new forms of knowledge emerge through novel integrations (cf. Tennant et al. 2020; Harnad 1998). If bits of data click together and are consistent with a pre-existing understanding of the world (which already clicks together), the new knowledge is deemed legitimate. Science is therefore considered to be self-correcting, since the act of assembling data to produce new knowledge is itself the means through which claims are verified or refuted. This resembles the means of evaluating contributions in open source projects, which emphasizes code’s functionality as a primary factor. If code does not run, there must be a bug, or an inconsistency in the program, that renders it non-functional (Kelty 2008: 220). Contributions to a collective code base are therefore said to be based on merit, or the skillful implementation of code, rather than according to the qualities of the programmer who committed the code (Coleman 2012: 121). This parallels the idealized conception of scientific knowledge production described above, in that contributions to a collective enterprise are considered to be disembodied, unambiguous and lacking positionality ascribed by the people who contributed them.\nThese transformations are genuine attempts to reify the adage that “information wants to be free”, which implies that information is constrained by external domineering forces — namely, the arbitrary restrictions imposed by copyright law and the use of proprietary media formats and communications protocols — and that information can and should exist in a boundless state, which is assumed to be more natural (cf. Harnad 1998). However this bears an unsettling resemblance to libertarian ideology in that each involve a spurious assumption that their key agents of concern are naturally independent and asocial beings, and that these isolated and atomic units may vaguely combine to form products of greater value, i.e. communities or states and knowledge, respectively. Value is ascribed based on market-based solutions (“the marketplace of ideas”), which assume that all actors within the system behave rationally and in accordance with the system’s built-in assumptions (Wellen 2004: 110). In a world where digital communications platforms have come to resemble state institutions to a great extent (cf. Gorwa 2019; Nieborg and Poell 2018), OA promises to enact a populist and anti-establishment vision for the future of scholarly communications, as illustrated by Suber (2003) who remarked that the OA revolution is the start of a new era wherein “scientific communication can be in the hands of scientists, who answer to one another, rather than corporations, who answer to shareholders.”\nAll of this colloquial imagery frames science as largely responsive to nature, and ignores how science constructs data. OA visions of science rarely take into account the double hermeneutic that is characteristic of social science research methods, which considers researchers’ roles in ascribing meaning to the objects that they identify and collect to begin with. And yet, the myth of unidirectional data production and processing persists even in archaeology, despite the discipline’s strong tendency for critical reflection regarding its own practices (Sørensen 2017: 107). This is perhaps due to the practical and bureaucratic contexts within which archaeological research operates, namely the need to produce particular kinds of research outputs that require specific kinds of stable inputs. For instance, since the functional value of archaeological data is associated with their usefulness for generating the kinds of reports that archaeologists deem valuable, which are typically one-way forms of communication that contribute to an additive process of knowledge production (i.e. journal articles, book manuscripts, conference presentations, etc), anything else, including “unofficial” or non-authoritative perspectives and discourse, is commonly deemed extraneous for the purposes of formal analysis, and tend to be dismissed as a lower or less professional form of archaeological engagement, despite wide recognition of their value in theoretical discourse (Hodder 1989: 273-274; Joyce 2002: 138-139). Thus, the information infrastructures and sociopolitical pressures that frame the value regimes of archaeological research together contribute to a particular vision of what data are and how they should be acted upon.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBevan, Andrew. 2015. “The Data Deluge.” Antiquity 89 (348): 1473–84. https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2015.102.\n\n\nBowker, Geoffrey C., Karen Baker, Florence Millerand, and David Ribes. 2010. “Toward Information Infrastructure Studies: Ways of Knowing in a Networked Environment.” In International Handbook of Internet Research, edited by Jeremy Hunsinger, Lisbeth Klastrup, and Matthew Allen, 97–117.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nSurveying the first quarter-century of computer applications in archaeology, Scollar (1999) lamented that the field relied almost exclusively on “hand-me-down” tools repurposed from other disciplines. Twenty five years later, this is no longer the case: computational archaeologists often find themselves practicing the dual roles of data analyst and research software engineer (Baxter et al. 2012; Schmidt and Marwick 2020), developing and applying new tools that are tailored specifically to archaeological problems and archaeological methods. Though this trend can be traced to the very earliest days of the field (Cowgill 1967), its most recent manifestation is distinguished by its apparent embrace of practices from free and open source software. Most prominently, since around 2015, there has been a rapid uptake of workflow tools designed for open source development communities, such as the version control system git and associated online source code management platforms (e.g. GitHub, GitLab). These tools facilitate collaboration among developers and users of open source software using patterns that can diverge quite radically from conventional scholarly norms (Tennant et al. 2020).\nIn this paper, we investigate modes of collaboration in this emerging community of practice using ‘open-archaeo’, a curated list of archaeological software, and data on the activity of associated GitHub repositories and users. We conduct an exploratory quantitative analysis to characterize the nature and intensity of these collaborations and map the collaborative networks that emerge from them. We document uneven adoption of open source collaborative practices beyond the basic use of git as a version control system and GitHub to host source code. Most projects do make use of collaborative features and, through shared contributions, we can can trace a collaborative network that includes the majority of archaeologists active on GitHub. However, a majority of repositories have 1–3 contributors, with only a few projects distinguished by an active and diverse developer base. Direct collaboration on code or other repository content—as opposed to the more passive, social media-style interaction that GitHub supports—remains very limited. In other words, there is little evidence that archaeologists’ adoption of open source tools (git and GitHub) has been accompanied by the decentralized, participatory forms of collaboration that characterise other open source communities. On the contrary, our results indicate that research software engineering in archaeology remains largely embedded in conventional professional norms and organizational structures of academia.\n\n\n\n\nGraph of open archaeology repositories and users connected by contributions\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\nVersion of record: https://doi.org/10.11141/ia.67.13\nPostprint: https://zackbatist.info/openarchaeo-collaboration\nResearch compendium: https://github.com/zackbatist/openarchaeo-collaboration\nZenodo archive: https://zenodo.org/records/12752060\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n BibTeX\n\n\n\n\n\n@article{batist2024,\ntitle = {Open Archaeology, Open Source?

    "title": "Archaeology as continuum of practice",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This notion of a continuum or network of practice is characterized by recognition of the diverse array of work enacted through collective effort to contribute to information commons. It accomplishes this by taking a pragmatic approach to understanding the situatedness, historicity and social contingency of work (Dallas 2015, 440; 2016).[^4] Dallas (2016) is explicit in his promotion of a landscape metaphor whose ecosystems and inhabitants negotiate their differences in a pragmatic manner rather than one that emphasizes control and resource. Moreover, this relates to Cole’s (1996) notion that culture is a permeable and layered substance that nurtures growth and development across uneven social landscapes. These views exemplify a broader trajectory that imagines knowledge work in ecological terms (cf. Star 1995).\nIn writing about specific issues regarding how scholarly content originating from various domains is professionally curated, Dallas brings attention to the ways in which such ecological metaphors might actually be applied. In his view, intellectual and pragmatic inquiry pertaining to the mindsets of the domains of knowledge production is necessary in order to better curate the meanings and intents behind archived material. Curation, for Dallas, is a continual process of interpretation and re-presentation; as objects (either physical or conceptual) are engaged with from various perspectives, they are ascribed new meanings. In other words, each interlocutor who engages with an object passing through their care as part of a curatorial process renews the object’s meaning in ways that both reflect the object’s history and shape its potential down the line. It is thus necessary, according to Dallas, to inquire about the ways in which domain specialists come to know an object and situate it as part of their lives in order to preserve and present the object in ways that adequately reflect its accrued meanings. This requires greater integration of domain specialists as part of curatorial workflows in order to better account for their outlooks as active stakeholders.\nThis outlook is interesting because it more clearly makes use of the notion that objects are sites of negotiation. Dallas (2015) applies these ideas to consider the ways in which the archaeological record is formulated and made meaningful in various ways throughout inherently collaborative, discursive and interdisciplinary archaeological projects. Indeed, his use-case is exemplary since relics, ruins and artefacts out of their original contexts serve as opportunistic lenses through which fragmentary glimpses of alternative realities might be captured. As Huvila (2016) notes, archaeological site reports, which are typically considered to represent the conclusive findings of a project, are produced from a series of complex negotiations among stakeholder specialists, but also present lopsided accounts of the knowledge recovered from the site; the organizational structure of archaeological projects, and the inherent epistemic limitations that guide the logistics and culture of the discipline, shape the final product and influence how it will be used in later secondary research contexts. In this sense, archaeological projects resemble, to some degree, “wicked” problems, whose contradictions, incompleteness and social complexity render them resistant to completely satisfying resolutions (Rittel and Webber 1973). However, further inquiry into the ways in which meanings are ascribed throughout the course of a project, as they accrue via pragmatic and situated experiences, may help to gain a better understanding of the tensions and relationships at play. By highlighting the complex textures of work contributed by various members of a project, those who wish to use the generated knowledge in alternative arenas of practice may gain a better feel for the ways in which it was woven, and thus use it more effectively.\nPaying close attention to the minute and pragmatic aspects of practice, is, according to Latour and Woolgar (1999, 24), what those in the fields of ‘science studies’ do best. By studying the particularities of what scientists actually do, and the ways in which they relate to things through series of coordinated social and technological mechanisms, we may be able to understand flows of knowledge across a continuum of understanding. By observing how professionals communicate and connect with each other and with the phenomena that captivate their interests, we can come to better understand the epistemic culture — the mindsets that drive curiosity and foster growth — which shapes the ways that they understand the world (Knorr Cetina 1999). As a result, scientific research, framed as a wide variety of active and cooperative engagements among people and objects, become situated alongside other ways of knowing. This is particularly important in a world where Mertonian notions of scholarly tribalism between the sciences, social sciences and humanities remain pervasive, despite many years of critique demonstrating that all scholarship actually occurs along an open continuum. In addition to helping foster more genuine cross-disciplinary encounters, recognition of the cultural situatedness of scholarship will enable scholars to more effectively operate in public and contribute towards the potential resolution of wicked problems.\n\nAn emerging perspective that sees archaeology as a continuum or network of practice. Emphasis is placed on situatedness, historicity and social contingency of archaeological work. Archaeological activities are viewed as acts of curation, whereby mediating objects are selected, interpreted, engaged with, transformed and ascribed new meanings in accordance with the particular methodological approaches employed. The mediating objects derived from a set of activities may then be leveraged as viable inputs for other activities, which may produce additional sets of outputs via their own investigative processes. Mediating objects may be accessed by multiple perspectives (by virtue of their externality, portability and indexicality) and their value may vary when incorporated into different sets of activities, according to the warrants, constraints and expectations that each activity entails. The processes involved in ensuring that mediating objects are compatible between perspectives are acts of collaboration, communication and community building.\nNotion of segmentation / articulation?\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCole, Michael. 1996. “Putting Culture in the Middle.” In Cultural Psychology: A Once and Future Discipline, 116–45.

You have a set of materials, a set of circumstances, and a hunch about what kinds of methods or activities might be amenable to obtaining a viable or useful result or output. Archaeological projects rely on people who have navigated or wayfared their way in a direction that is useful to the projects’ purposes. Archaeology does not ‘borrow’ from other disciplines. In fact, it is a locus where wayfaring individuals may get together and assemble their experiences to address questions of archaeological concern. A key difference between archaeologists who specialize in X and X-ologists who dabble in archaeology is the ability to consider constraints or limitations imposed by the fragmentary input materials, the alignment to broader goals and understandings of what kinds of knowledge are capable to achieve. Archaeologists are ‘realistic’, they know when something may be genuinely useful and how to call bullshit, but this requires or is founded upon a presumption of a common sense of purpose or communal understanding of goals.\n\nRelations with other disciplines\nAs a field-based discipline, archaeology shares ethos with ecology, geology and palaeontology.

Self-awareness is particularly important in recognizing and correcting with archaeology’s colonial origins and continuing tendencies. There is also a tendency for archaeologists to theorize about the discipline in non-robust ways. For instance, some archaeologists have recently been obsessed with Latour’s actor-network theory to document socio-technical systems and interactions, without necessarily reflecting upon the limits of the approach (Collins and Yearley 1992) or anything that critically extends Latour’s original work (i.e. Knorr-Cetina’s Epistemic Cultures, a lost of work coming out of feminist posthumanism). I think that a lot of uncertainty has arisen from the ‘post-theoretical’ period that we are thought to inhabit (if we are to follow the chronological model of archaeological theory), which I would prefer to call pragmatism as driven by neoliberalism. Thinking about systems and interoperability of agents/actants may help reify and legitimate the actants even when they are rarely well-defined or justified, and explanations regarding their variable motivations and outlooks pertaining to their assumed interactions are rarely explored in depth.\nSome common tropes include:\n\ninfrastructures as information pipelines, helping transform ‘raw’ data into refined and value-added products\nthe [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid| data-information-knowledge-wisdom pyramid]\nuse of munsell charts as representations of trained perspectives"

    "title": "On the limits of actor-network theory",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Previous work examining the apparatus of science relies heavily on Actor-Network Theory (ANT) or similar approaches that highlight the agency and impacts of tools on research practice. These draw attention to how non-human objects not only frame how human beings inhabit the world, but “push back” upon human actions with significant effects (Latour 1992). In the context of early studies of scientific research, ANT was used to understand the physical and communicative mechanisms — made up of non-human agents and information objects — upon which scientists rely to capture, document and ascribe meaning to particular facets of the world (cf. Latour and Woolgar 1986). ANT posits that scientists can only identify, characterize and understand objects of interest by co-creating their conceptions of reality alongside non-human agents.\nFor instance, (Latour and Woolgar 1986) initially applied ANT to investigate how knowledge is produced by molecular biologists in a laboratory setting. In this work, they identified the processes of transcription and translation as mechanisms through which material engagements between non-human objects (i.e. objects of nature) are rendered in ways that may be understood by humans. For instance, in a biomolecular lab, a bioassay determines and represents the existence and qualities of discrete proteins that have been extracted from cell samples through reactions with specially selected reagents, marked with dyes selected for their non-reactive qualities, and pulled through a filtration medium that separates proteins according to their mass, molecular structure, and electromagnetic properties. A large number of material entities are thus selected and mobilized due to the researcher’s understanding that such an assemblage might contribute to the representation of a targeted set of phenomena. More specifically, certain reagents are added to cell samples that bind with proteins that constitute cell walls, allowing for inner proteins to be extracted. Other reagents that only bind to particular targeted proteins and that have been engineered to have certain identifiable physical and electromagnetic properties impart these qualities onto the now merged molecule composed of both targeted protein and reagent. Dyes that complement the design of the reagent and of the overall bioassay protocol are bound to these molecules, rendering them visible to the human eye. Molecules are then pulled through a conductive gel whose own material characteristics and density allow for only electrically charged molecules to be pulled through, given the placement of a polar-opposite charge at the far end of the gel. Once movement of the proteins have settled, (caused, in part, by the gradual solidification of the gel that inhibits further movement) the entire gel is photographed and the relative positions of dyed molecules are marked to denote their discrete existence and other relevant qualities rendered through association with their respective reagents. Knowledge was thus obtained by humans through the selective assembly of various material actors, whose interactions are already understood and deemed reliable, in order to render an account of reality based upon their projected experiences.\nSuch a comprehensive view of the system of interacting agents, however, betrays the pragmatic and situated nature of the process. Indeed, Latour and Woolgar (1986, 245) concluded that science is primarily concerned with the creation of an ordered account of reality, rather than the transfer of information pertaining to the world into human-understandable formats, and they characterize latter as the practices enacted in order to fulfill the former aim. However through a pragmatic lens, these two processes may be rendered as intertwined and inseparable threads of a unified experience of knowledge production.\nRealizing this, Knorr Cetina (2001) highlighted how every action taken in the production of knowledge is underpinned by a desire to fill a gap in knowledge. Integral to this approach is her definition of knowledge objects, which are defined as settled statements about the world, which tend to be the goal of most scientific pursuits. Knorr-Cetina illustrates this as drawers in a filing cabinet, which have been organized squarely and that are accessible for retrieval. In contrast, gaps in knowledge or unexpected behaviour are characterized as untidy and incomplete drawers that exist in an unresolved state. Knowledge objects are comparable to Latour and Woolgar’s (1986, 76) definition of facts as timeless and author-less accounts of reality, which have been elevated from the material systems that would otherwise constrain them as contingent to the specific material setup of the lab. However, Knorr-Cetina’s concept renders knowledge production as a more dynamic, constructive and situated process that involves the use of already established knowledge in the validation of newly arrived at ideas (Knorr Cetina 2001, 181–82).\nHer approach adds pragmatic and discursive elements, which help frame scholarly practices from the perspectives of the practitioners themselves, in terms of potentiality, certainty and desire. For instance, the desire of a lab technician to have the protein react as she expects it to will guide her practices, including her selection of reagents used to interact with it (Knorr Cetina 2001, 181). She thus alters the material assemblage of the system based upon her contextualization of what has or has not worked before, her educated hypothetical suppositions concerning the ways various actors might interact, and a reiteration of her goal. Her concern with the elusive nature of the protein thereby derives from her consideration of how the knowledge she might obtain will fit into the established order.\nKnorr Cetina’s work reveals how ANT does not adequately account for the circumstances through which the structures that support science come into being, nor the intentionality of human agents who assemble material apparatus to meet their goals. She refocuses attention on discursive aspects of knowledge production by considering expressions of potentiality, certainty and desire elicited by scientists as subjects acting with intent. This emphasis on the role of the subject, who conceives of other things from a unique perspective, introduces some asymmetry with respect to the roles of actors in the overall system. However, it does not totally dismiss the agency of non-human actors; it merely recognizes that the agency of objects are harnessed by humans and strategically configured into productive systems.\nIn other words, this approach recognizes that a scientific observer is needed to intervene, who ascribes meanings to materials, who delineates natural phenomena from modern cultural processes, and who selects signal from noise. It also enables science to be viewed as a collaborative and discursive process, comprising a convergence of methodologies and theoretical outlooks, often upon the same materials. This prompts recognition that ‘the scientific record’ exists in multiple forms, and varies according to the diverse range of perspectives that may characterize the objects of enquiry in different ways. When presenting their findings, scientists thus engage in discursive processes of semantic negotiation, comparing our own conceptions to those held by others.\nScientific data may therefore be considered as a connective medium that enables research to be conducted in a continuous and collaborative manner.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKnorr Cetina, Karin. 2001. “Objectual Practice.” In The Practice Turn in Contemporary Theory, edited by Theodore R.

    "text": "This draws from Gardin’s (1989: 15-16) logicist approach, which considers descriptive propositions as constituting the evidential basis for derived interpretive propositions, as linked together through a series of intermediate propositions via argumentation. The articulation (e.g. jointed, hinged in nature) of mediating objects and activities may be drawn out as long chains, which may be used to infer propositions about connected mediating object and notions that they represent.\nFor example: Soil samples are the mediating objects that flow into the activity of flotation, which produces different sets of mediating objects including botanical samples and heavy residue. Botanical samples may then be processed by an activity that entails identifying and sorting the materials, and carbonized remains might be produced as a derived set of [objects]. In turn, these may be used as mediating objects for the purpose of radiocarbon analysis activities, which produces uncalibrated datasets (mediating objects) that are fed into a calibration program (activity) to produce calibrated dates (mediating objects). In this sense, [objects] are entities that play a practical role in ongoing work. This contrasts with my conception of knowledge, which is more distant, abstract, borderless and fundamental (in the sense that new work has to reckon with existing knowledge)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Activity systems are systematic articulations of various aspects of practice, which are helpful for documenting how procedures, or normative plans of action, are enacted. Activities are comprised of a series of actions, which contribute towards, but do not completely satisfy on their own, the activity’s objectives. Actions are therefore considered to be intermediate processes that work in tandem to achieve greater ends (Leont’ev 1974: 23). Actions are executed in response to specific tasks, which are goals that are constrained by specific conditions. In order to realize these goals, actors conduct operations, which are dictated by these practical conditions (Leont’ev 1974: 25-26). Successful operations that lead to the completion of a task bring about new conditions that call for new tasks to address following their own sets of actions and operations. Such chains of tasks warranting further actions and operations are referred to as procuedures or routines (Leont’ev 1974: 26-27). In order to achieve an activity’s objectives, it is necessary to mobilize a series of tools. Tools are the physical or conceptual entities that are harnessed in the operationalization of tasks. Tools enable operations to go forward by allowing actors to overcome the conditions that separate actors’ current states from their desired goals (Leont’ev 1974: 27-28).\nIt’s also important to distinguish between tools and mediating objects. In my mind, tools are like independent variables, whose effects, when applied in certain ways, are predictable, consistent and well understood; this motivates their selection as helpful entities. On the other hand, mediating objects are like dependent variables, interchangeable entities that ‘flow through’ an activity, that are acted upon and elicit varied responses, which are then slotted into or normalized against controlled schemas or formats when rendered as an activity’s outputs.\nI draw from the vocabulary of activity theory as a handy way to break down and articulate various aspects of practice, particularly to document how procedures, or normative plans of action, are actually enacted. I think that the emphasis on goal-setting and goal-attainment may be very useful for examining the situatedness of practice, particularly with regards to the different goals that people set, the different roles that common tools and mediating objects may have, and the potential for activities and the goals that drive them to be interdependent, nested or otherwise conducted in parallel, complementary or mutualistic ways. As such, I am not interested in documenting activity systems for the sake of articulating a map of interconnected components and relations (cf. Engeström 2000). Instead, I will use the framework provided as a means eliciting the characteristics of collaborative intersections."

ANT posits that scientists can only identify, characterize and understand objects of interest by co-creating their conceptions of reality alongside non-human agents. Latour and Woolgar stated that science is primarily concerned with the creation of an ordered account of reality, rather than the transfer of information pertaining to the world into human-understandable formats. They characterize the latter of these two propositions as the practices enacted in order to fulfill the former aim. However, from a pragmatic perspective, these two processes may be rendered as intertwined and inseparable threads of a unified experience of knowledge production (Latour and Woolgar 1986: 245)."

A large number of material entities are thus selected and mobilized due to the researcher’s understanding that such an assemblage might contribute to the representation of a targeted set of phenomena. More specifically, certain reagents are added to cell samples that bind with proteins that constitute cell walls, allowing for inner proteins to be extracted. Other reagents that only bind to particular targeted proteins and that have been engineered to have certain identifiable physical and electromagnetic properties impart these qualities onto the now merged molecule composed of both targeted protein and reagent. Dyes that complement the design of the reagent and of the overall bioassay protocol are bound to these molecules, rendering them visible to the human eye. Molecules are then pulled through a conductive gel whose own material characteristics and density allow for only electrically charged molecules to be pulled through, given the placement of a polar-opposite charge at the far end of the gel. Once movement of the proteins have settled, (caused, in part, by the gradual solidification of the gel that inhibits further movement) the entire gel is photographed and the relative positions of dyed molecules are marked to denote their discrete existence and other relevant qualities rendered through association with their respective reagents. Knowledge is thus obtained by humans through the selective assembly of various material actors, whose interactions are already understood and deemed reliable, in order to render an account of reality based upon their projected experiences."

    "text": "The notion of the archaeological record encapsulates two quite different perspectives: first, as the totality of the material remains of past cultures found by archaeologists through survey or excavation, and second, as the documentary archive derived through a recording process from these material remains (Dallas 2015). The physical record of material occupies the empirical domain when materials are found, excavated, individualized and selected, and then subsequently represented, transformed and interpreted to construct a textual record. The archaeological record as a documentary archive, which comprises the traces and inscriptions of archaeological facts made in the light of the prior knowledge, middle range theories, intuitions, and sense experiences of archaeologists as they conduct their research, is constructed at the same time as its material form is irrevocably destroyed through excavation, gradually taking its place as evidence. These physical and informational aspects of the archaeological record each formulate the other. The informational archaeological record is recognized as a product of the physical collection and analysis of materials, and the physical record is formulated and delimited through the conception of materials by the minds of archaeologists. This way of thinking about the formulation of the archaeological record puts activity at centre stage. An archaeological observer is needed to intervene, who ascribes meanings to materials, who delineates natural phenomena from cultural processes, who differentiates signs of modern intervention from activities performed by the archaeological other, and who selects signal from noise.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDallas, Costis. 2015. “Curating Archaeological Knowledge in the Digital Continuum: From Practice to Infrastructure.” Open Archaeology 1 (1): 176–207. https://doi.org/10.1515/opar-2015-0011."
