Epistemic cultures are cultures of creating and warranting knowledge; 'epistemic' refers to knowledge and truth-related goals and practices as central elements of scientific and professional fields [@knorrcetina2015].
Framing scientific research as culture helps investigate knowledge production as collective, materializing, interactive, historical, social, political and informally learned human process.
It allows me to see archaeological practice as peculiar.
It allows me to consider how normative assumptions and dispositions are taken for granted as the only viable ways or acting or thinking.
