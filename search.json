The physical record of material occupies the empirical domain when materials are found, excavated, individualized and selected, and then subsequently represented, transformed and interpreted to construct a textual record. The archaeological record as a documentary archive, which comprises the traces and inscriptions of archaeological facts made in the light of the prior knowledge, middle range theories, intuitions, and sense experiences of archaeologists as they conduct their research, is constructed at the same time as its material form is irrevocably destroyed through excavation, gradually taking its place as evidence. These physical and informational aspects of the archaeological record each formulate the other. The informational archaeological record is recognized as a product of the physical collection and analysis of materials, and the physical record is formulated and delimited through the conception of materials by the minds of archaeologists. This way of thinking about the formulation of the archaeological record puts activity at centre stage. An archaeological observer is needed to intervene, who ascribes meanings to materials, who delineates natural phenomena from cultural processes, who differentiates signs of modern intervention from activities performed by the archaeological other, and who selects signal from noise.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDallas, Costis. 2015. “Curating Archaeological Knowledge in the Digital Continuum: From Practice to Infrastructure.” Open Archaeology 1 (1): 176–207. https://doi.org/10.1515/opar-2015-0011."

    "text": "Activity systems are systematic articulations of various aspects of practice, which are helpful for documenting how procedures, or normative plans of action, are enacted. Activities are comprised of a series of actions, which contribute towards, but do not completely satisfy on their own, the activity’s objectives. Actions are therefore considered to be intermediate processes that work in tandem to achieve greater ends (Leont’ev 1974: 23). Actions are executed in response to specific tasks, which are goals that are constrained by specific conditions. In order to realize these goals, actors conduct operations, which are dictated by these practical conditions (Leont’ev 1974: 25-26). Successful operations that lead to the completion of a task bring about new conditions that call for new tasks to address following their own sets of actions and operations. Such chains of tasks warranting further actions and operations are referred to as procuedures or routines (Leont’ev 1974: 26-27). In order to achieve an activity’s objectives, it is necessary to mobilize a series of tools. Tools are the physical or conceptual entities that are harnessed in the operationalization of tasks. Tools enable operations to go forward by allowing actors to overcome the conditions that separate actors’ current states from their desired goals (Leont’ev 1974: 27-28).\nIt’s also important to distinguish between tools and mediating objects. In my mind, tools are like independent variables, whose effects, when applied in certain ways, are predictable, consistent and well understood; this motivates their selection as helpful entities. On the other hand, mediating objects are like dependent variables, interchangeable entities that ‘flow through’ an activity, that are acted upon and elicit varied responses, which are then slotted into or normalized against controlled schemas or formats when rendered as an activity’s outputs.\nI draw from the vocabulary of activity theory as a handy way to break down and articulate various aspects of practice, particularly to document how procedures, or normative plans of action, are actually enacted. I think that the emphasis on goal-setting and goal-attainment may be very useful for examining the situatedness of practice, particularly with regards to the different goals that people set, the different roles that common tools and mediating objects may have, and the potential for activities and the goals that drive them to be interdependent, nested or otherwise conducted in parallel, complementary or mutualistic ways. As such, I am not interested in documenting activity systems for the sake of articulating a map of interconnected components and relations (cf. Engeström 2000). Instead, I will use the framework provided as a means eliciting the characteristics of collaborative intersections."

Botanical samples may then be processed by an activity that entails identifying and sorting the materials, and carbonized remains might be produced as a derived set of [objects]. In turn, these may be used as mediating objects for the purpose of radiocarbon analysis activities, which produces uncalibrated datasets (mediating objects) that are fed into a calibration program (activity) to produce calibrated dates (mediating objects). In this sense, [objects] are entities that play a practical role in ongoing work.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Previous work examining the apparatus of science relies heavily on Actor-Network Theory (ANT) or similar approaches that highlight the agency and impacts of tools on research practice. These draw attention to how non-human objects not only frame how human beings inhabit the world, but “push back” upon human actions with significant effects (Latour 1992). In the context of early studies of scientific research, ANT was used to understand the physical and communicative mechanisms — made up of non-human agents and information objects — upon which scientists rely to capture, document and ascribe meaning to particular facets of the world (cf. Latour and Woolgar 1986). ANT posits that scientists can only identify, characterize and understand objects of interest by co-creating their conceptions of reality alongside non-human agents.\nFor instance, (Latour and Woolgar 1986) initially applied ANT to investigate how knowledge is produced by molecular biologists in a laboratory setting. In this work, they identified the processes of transcription and translation as mechanisms through which material engagements between non-human objects (i.e. objects of nature) are rendered in ways that may be understood by humans. For instance, in a biomolecular lab, a bioassay determines and represents the existence and qualities of discrete proteins that have been extracted from cell samples through reactions with specially selected reagents, marked with dyes selected for their non-reactive qualities, and pulled through a filtration medium that separates proteins according to their mass, molecular structure, and electromagnetic properties. A large number of material entities are thus selected and mobilized due to the researcher’s understanding that such an assemblage might contribute to the representation of a targeted set of phenomena. More specifically, certain reagents are added to cell samples that bind with proteins that constitute cell walls, allowing for inner proteins to be extracted. Other reagents that only bind to particular targeted proteins and that have been engineered to have certain identifiable physical and electromagnetic properties impart these qualities onto the now merged molecule composed of both targeted protein and reagent. Dyes that complement the design of the reagent and of the overall bioassay protocol are bound to these molecules, rendering them visible to the human eye. Molecules are then pulled through a conductive gel whose own material characteristics and density allow for only electrically charged molecules to be pulled through, given the placement of a polar-opposite charge at the far end of the gel. Once movement of the proteins have settled, (caused, in part, by the gradual solidification of the gel that inhibits further movement) the entire gel is photographed and the relative positions of dyed molecules are marked to denote their discrete existence and other relevant qualities rendered through association with their respective reagents. Knowledge was thus obtained by humans through the selective assembly of various material actors, whose interactions are already understood and deemed reliable, in order to render an account of reality based upon their projected experiences.\nSuch a comprehensive view of the system of interacting agents, however, betrays the pragmatic and situated nature of the process. Indeed, Latour and Woolgar (1986, 245) concluded that science is primarily concerned with the creation of an ordered account of reality, rather than the transfer of information pertaining to the world into human-understandable formats, and they characterize latter as the practices enacted in order to fulfill the former aim. However through a pragmatic lens, these two processes may be rendered as intertwined and inseparable threads of a unified experience of knowledge production.\nRealizing this, Knorr Cetina (2001) highlighted how every action taken in the production of knowledge is underpinned by a desire to fill a gap in knowledge. Integral to this approach is her definition of knowledge objects, which are defined as settled statements about the world, which tend to be the goal of most scientific pursuits. Knorr-Cetina illustrates this as drawers in a filing cabinet, which have been organized squarely and that are accessible for retrieval. In contrast, gaps in knowledge or unexpected behaviour are characterized as untidy and incomplete drawers that exist in an unresolved state. Knowledge objects are comparable to Latour and Woolgar’s (1986, 76) definition of facts as timeless and author-less accounts of reality, which have been elevated from the material systems that would otherwise constrain them as contingent to the specific material setup of the lab. However, Knorr-Cetina’s concept renders knowledge production as a more dynamic, constructive and situated process that involves the use of already established knowledge in the validation of newly arrived at ideas (Knorr Cetina 2001, 181–82).\nHer approach adds pragmatic and discursive elements, which help frame scholarly practices from the perspectives of the practitioners themselves, in terms of potentiality, certainty and desire. For instance, the desire of a lab technician to have the protein react as she expects it to will guide her practices, including her selection of reagents used to interact with it (Knorr Cetina 2001, 181). She thus alters the material assemblage of the system based upon her contextualization of what has or has not worked before, her educated hypothetical suppositions concerning the ways various actors might interact, and a reiteration of her goal. Her concern with the elusive nature of the protein thereby derives from her consideration of how the knowledge she might obtain will fit into the established order.\nKnorr Cetina’s work reveals how ANT does not adequately account for the circumstances through which the structures that support science come into being, nor the intentionality of human agents who assemble material apparatus to meet their goals. She refocuses attention on discursive aspects of knowledge production by considering expressions of potentiality, certainty and desire elicited by scientists as subjects acting with intent. This emphasis on the role of the subject, who conceives of other things from a unique perspective, introduces some asymmetry with respect to the roles of actors in the overall system. However, it does not totally dismiss the agency of non-human actors; it merely recognizes that the agency of objects are harnessed by humans and strategically configured into productive systems.\nIn other words, this approach recognizes that a scientific observer is needed to intervene, who ascribes meanings to materials, who delineates natural phenomena from modern cultural processes, and who selects signal from noise. It also enables science to be viewed as a collaborative and discursive process, comprising a convergence of methodologies and theoretical outlooks, often upon the same materials. This prompts recognition that ‘the scientific record’ exists in multiple forms, and varies according to the diverse range of perspectives that may characterize the objects of enquiry in different ways. When presenting their findings, scientists thus engage in discursive processes of semantic negotiation, comparing our own conceptions to those held by others.\nScientific data may therefore be considered as a connective medium that enables research to be conducted in a continuous and collaborative manner.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKnorr Cetina, Karin. 2001. “Objectual Practice.” In The Practice Turn in Contemporary Theory, edited by Theodore R.

Where the initial thought was to lean more towards Jefferson Notation, I think that an adapted GAT 2 (GesprächsanalytischesTranskriptionssystem) notation is a) better suited and b) easier to read and use.\n\n\nLiterary transcription appears to be the best approach for the needs of the E-CURATORS Project. Where it is tempting and more time efficient to go with a standard orthography approach, deviations from standard pronunciation by the speaker would be lost. Literary transcription includes utterances such as “umm” “ahh”, hesitation markers, and false starts, which may produce meaningful results in the coding process. Further, an eye dialect perhaps provides too much detail, and is critiqued for poor readability, inconsistency and incorrect phonetics. Therefore, prosodic components such as how the words are spoken in terms of the characteristics of pitch, loudness and duration will be ignored. However, paralinguistic component should be considered. These include vocal features occurring during speaking but not as part of the linguistic system, for example include audible breathing, crying, aspiration and laughter.

You have a set of materials, a set of circumstances, and a hunch about what kinds of methods or activities might be amenable to obtaining a viable or useful result or output. Archaeological projects rely on people who have navigated or wayfared their way in a direction that is useful to the projects’ purposes. Archaeology does not ‘borrow’ from other disciplines. In fact, it is a locus where wayfaring individuals may get together and assemble their experiences to address questions of archaeological concern. A key difference between archaeologists who specialize in X and X-ologists who dabble in archaeology is the ability to consider constraints or limitations imposed by the fragmentary input materials, the alignment to broader goals and understandings of what kinds of knowledge are capable to achieve. Archaeologists are ‘realistic’, they know when something may be genuinely useful and how to call bullshit, but this requires or is founded upon a presumption of a common sense of purpose or communal understanding of goals.\n\nRelations with other disciplines\nAs a field-based discipline, archaeology shares ethos with ecology, geology and palaeontology.

Self-awareness is particularly important in recognizing and correcting with archaeology’s colonial origins and continuing tendencies. There is also a tendency for archaeologists to theorize about the discipline in non-robust ways. For instance, some archaeologists have recently been obsessed with Latour’s actor-network theory to document socio-technical systems and interactions, without necessarily reflecting upon the limits of the approach (Collins and Yearley 1992) or anything that critically extends Latour’s original work (i.e. Knorr-Cetina’s Epistemic Cultures, a lost of work coming out of feminist posthumanism). I think that a lot of uncertainty has arisen from the ‘post-theoretical’ period that we are thought to inhabit (if we are to follow the chronological model of archaeological theory), which I would prefer to call pragmatism as driven by neoliberalism. Thinking about systems and interoperability of agents/actants may help reify and legitimate the actants even when they are rarely well-defined or justified, and explanations regarding their variable motivations and outlooks pertaining to their assumed interactions are rarely explored in depth.\nSome common tropes include:\n\ninfrastructures as information pipelines, helping transform ‘raw’ data into refined and value-added products\nthe [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid| data-information-knowledge-wisdom pyramid]\nuse of munsell charts as representations of trained perspectives"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This notion of a continuum or network of practice is characterized by recognition of the diverse array of work enacted through collective effort to contribute to information commons. It accomplishes this by taking a pragmatic approach to understanding the situatedness, historicity and social contingency of work (Dallas 2015, 440; 2016).[^4] Dallas (2016) is explicit in his promotion of a landscape metaphor whose ecosystems and inhabitants negotiate their differences in a pragmatic manner rather than one that emphasizes control and resource. Moreover, this relates to Cole’s (1996) notion that culture is a permeable and layered substance that nurtures growth and development across uneven social landscapes. These views exemplify a broader trajectory that imagines knowledge work in ecological terms (cf. Star 1995).\nIn writing about specific issues regarding how scholarly content originating from various domains is professionally curated, Dallas brings attention to the ways in which such ecological metaphors might actually be applied. In his view, intellectual and pragmatic inquiry pertaining to the mindsets of the domains of knowledge production is necessary in order to better curate the meanings and intents behind archived material. Curation, for Dallas, is a continual process of interpretation and re-presentation; as objects (either physical or conceptual) are engaged with from various perspectives, they are ascribed new meanings. In other words, each interlocutor who engages with an object passing through their care as part of a curatorial process renews the object’s meaning in ways that both reflect the object’s history and shape its potential down the line. It is thus necessary, according to Dallas, to inquire about the ways in which domain specialists come to know an object and situate it as part of their lives in order to preserve and present the object in ways that adequately reflect its accrued meanings. This requires greater integration of domain specialists as part of curatorial workflows in order to better account for their outlooks as active stakeholders.\nThis outlook is interesting because it more clearly makes use of the notion that objects are sites of negotiation. Dallas (2015) applies these ideas to consider the ways in which the archaeological record is formulated and made meaningful in various ways throughout inherently collaborative, discursive and interdisciplinary archaeological projects. Indeed, his use-case is exemplary since relics, ruins and artefacts out of their original contexts serve as opportunistic lenses through which fragmentary glimpses of alternative realities might be captured. As Huvila (2016) notes, archaeological site reports, which are typically considered to represent the conclusive findings of a project, are produced from a series of complex negotiations among stakeholder specialists, but also present lopsided accounts of the knowledge recovered from the site; the organizational structure of archaeological projects, and the inherent epistemic limitations that guide the logistics and culture of the discipline, shape the final product and influence how it will be used in later secondary research contexts. In this sense, archaeological projects resemble, to some degree, “wicked” problems, whose contradictions, incompleteness and social complexity render them resistant to completely satisfying resolutions (Rittel and Webber 1973). However, further inquiry into the ways in which meanings are ascribed throughout the course of a project, as they accrue via pragmatic and situated experiences, may help to gain a better understanding of the tensions and relationships at play. By highlighting the complex textures of work contributed by various members of a project, those who wish to use the generated knowledge in alternative arenas of practice may gain a better feel for the ways in which it was woven, and thus use it more effectively.\nPaying close attention to the minute and pragmatic aspects of practice, is, according to Latour and Woolgar (1999, 24), what those in the fields of ‘science studies’ do best. By studying the particularities of what scientists actually do, and the ways in which they relate to things through series of coordinated social and technological mechanisms, we may be able to understand flows of knowledge across a continuum of understanding. By observing how professionals communicate and connect with each other and with the phenomena that captivate their interests, we can come to better understand the epistemic culture — the mindsets that drive curiosity and foster growth — which shapes the ways that they understand the world (Knorr Cetina 1999). As a result, scientific research, framed as a wide variety of active and cooperative engagements among people and objects, become situated alongside other ways of knowing. This is particularly important in a world where Mertonian notions of scholarly tribalism between the sciences, social sciences and humanities remain pervasive, despite many years of critique demonstrating that all scholarship actually occurs along an open continuum. In addition to helping foster more genuine cross-disciplinary encounters, recognition of the cultural situatedness of scholarship will enable scholars to more effectively operate in public and contribute towards the potential resolution of wicked problems.\n\nAn emerging perspective that sees archaeology as a continuum or network of practice. Emphasis is placed on situatedness, historicity and social contingency of archaeological work. Archaeological activities are viewed as acts of curation, whereby mediating objects are selected, interpreted, engaged with, transformed and ascribed new meanings in accordance with the particular methodological approaches employed. The mediating objects derived from a set of activities may then be leveraged as viable inputs for other activities, which may produce additional sets of outputs via their own investigative processes. Mediating objects may be accessed by multiple perspectives (by virtue of their externality, portability and indexicality) and their value may vary when incorporated into different sets of activities, according to the warrants, constraints and expectations that each activity entails. The processes involved in ensuring that mediating objects are compatible between perspectives are acts of collaboration, communication and community building.\nNotion of segmentation / articulation?\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCole, Michael. 1996. “Putting Culture in the Middle.” In Cultural Psychology: A Once and Future Discipline, 116–45.

    "text": "Curation encompasses a theoretical perspective, developed by Dallas (2007, 2015), that I adopt as a way to consider how mediating objects are continuously selected, interpreted, engaged with, transformed and ascribed new meanings through series of situated and pragmatic activities. Mediating objects capacity to mediate between multiple perspectives (by virtue of their externality, portability and indexicality) is prioritized over their roles as documentary or evidential record. Mediating objects are considered as sites of negotiation, whose value may vary when incorporated into different sets of activities, according to the warrants, constraints and expectations that each activity entails. Archaeology is considered as a continuum or network of practice, as opposed to a linear progression or research cycle. This entails taking a pragmatic approach to understanding the situatedness, historicity and social contingency of archaeological work. (Peircian notion of the index, his preference for upholding knowledge through multiple cables rather than a singular chain (and adoption by Wylie (1989)), pragmatic maxim implies the possibility of alternative approaches, i.e. a continuum of possible engagements)\n\nPeirce approaches the problem of verification from the perspective of is pragmatic maxim. He shifts the burden of testing away from the outcome of a single study conducted by one scientist to the outcome of multiple studies conducted by the scientific community. Truth is thus not an absolute, but rather a never-ending social inquiry and its status is rendered by the scientific community not at any particular moment in time, but in the long-run Preucel (2006): 254.\n\nDraws from the notion of digital curation (Yakel 2007).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDallas, Costis. 2007. “An Agency-Oriented Approach to Digital Curation Theory and Practice.” In ICHIM07 - International Cultural Heritage Informatics Meeting, Proceedings 2007, 1p.

    "title": "Activity theory",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Examines the systematically-organized series of relations that comprise activities. Activities are understood as the relations between human subjects and the physical or conceptual tools or environments with or within which they act, and the motives or objectives that drive the system forward in a particular direction (Leont’ev 1974: 22-23). Activity theory is useful to examine how people mobilize a series of physical and conceptual tools to overcome the conditions that separate actors’ current states from their desired goals. In this sense, activity theory prioritizes the situated perspectives and experiences of human subjects while still trying to account for the agency that tools exhibit in their experiences as components of activity systems delegated towards addressing particular tasks. More specifically, activity theory helps to draw generalized accounts of practices employed in research projects. Documenting taken-for-granted aspects of work in a structured manner provides a unique window into how such practices contribute to broader disciplinary norms or professional mindsets. Recorded conversations and observations of enacted practices may be compared to determine how goals and strategies for achieving them are drawn up with the actual implementation of tasks. This contributes to understanding how certain challenges are perceived by involved stakeholders, how contingencies are accounted for, and how indicators of success may change as work progresses. Using activity theory effectively is not about describing the minute processes of enacted work, but rather about investigating how tasks and operations are strategically implemented as part of a coordinated effort to achieve broader goals.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEngeström, Y. 2000. “Activity Theory as a Framework for Analyzing and Redesigning Work.” Ergonomics 43 (7): 960–74. https://doi.org/10.1080/001401300409143.\n\n\nLeont’ev, A.

    "text": "Kinds of agency\nThese are all roles, attitudes or activities that switch or overlap depending on context, or on the activity of focus. This is more about recognizing roles and how they shift in different inter-related contexts.\nAn originator creates original entities. Founding directors are the originators of projects. While projects may be prompted by earlier work and lingering questions or concerns, the act of establishing a project is a significant milestone. The act of creating a trench in the context of the overall site situates the field director as the originator. The act of creating a trench in the context of the progression of work and the recording of its contents situates the trench supervisor as the originator.\nA schematizer identifies, distinguishes, relates and prioritizes attention towards particular entities or kinds of entities. Schematizers set rules regarding how things should be done, framing subsequent work done by others. Writing the excavation manual, giving an instructional demonstration of how to characterize sediments, introducing staff and their roles at the start of a project are all examples of schematizing.\nA formalizer fits ‘fuzzy’ notions into concrete, discrete and orderly structures. They may also implement stricter and enforceable rules within recording systems. Translates between imprecise archaeological practices and the formal demands of the broader scientific enterprise. Thinking ahead, and in terms of the ‘big-picture’, the progression of work in the long term.\nA motivator rallies people and creates an environment where people are not only excited to perform their tasks, but to do them properly and as stipulated by established guidelines. This can be specific people on site who act as role models, visiting experts who prompt greater rigour, or local liaisons who garner support to accept foreigners into their communities.\nAn automaton is someone who responds to direction given by others. Automatons are typically novices, but may graduate to become 1st level intermediaries if they are able to abstract their experiences out from directly local circumstances as knowledge, and incorporate these experiences and knowledge into future work.\nA consultant is someone who works in their own manner and has wide leeway to work independently, but is ultimately motivated to contribute to the projects communal aims. Specialists are typically consultants, except when their work is integral to the project and relate to core schematization that inform further work. Consultants’ work tends to be offshoots of the core project and the results of their inquiry are often used as supportive evidence rather than as direct/original/root claims; however, they may prompt further core work to be done, but this may be more a matter of good timing than standard procedure."

    "text": "Here are some ideas on how we task our ontology / conceptual model in our methodology.\n\nOverview\nAn ontology-based approach to qualitative data analysis, such as we advocate, calls for expressing the implied conceptualisation of a field (in our case, archaeological digital practice, including aspects of cognition and motivation of actors that shape action in the practice, as well as the role of diverse, both conceptual and physical/digital, mediating tools) in terms of a formal specification which will capture: (a) the main entities in the field at the level of granularity that captures our intuitions on how the field is structured, and (b) their properties and relationships (and their properties) that are relevant to our conception of the field. Relationships include ontological (mainly specialisation/generalisation, thorugh a class hierarchy, as well as mereological through a part-of hierarchy if relevant) and semantic ones related to the specifics of our field (e.g. Activity has_actor Actor, Document has_format Format). This formal representation should allow simple stuff (evidence presented in an interview, an archaeological activity described or observed) to be expressed simply, more complex stuff to be represented in an analogously more complex manner, and should allow us to pose useful questions and make useful inferences about the kinds of questions we are asking.\nWhile an ontology can be perfectly defined (in tools such as Protege) as a class hierarchy, and then semantic relationships are buried within properties in the property sheet of each class), most ontology builders will provide the important conceptual structures captured by the ontology in one or more \"top level\" diagrams. Examples are the \"activities as meetings between actors, objects, place and timespans\" diagram of CIDOC CRM, or the main structure and agency, procedure etc. perspective diagrams of Scholarly Ontology.\n\n\nUsing the model\nThe use of the model within E-CURATORS is twofold:\n\nIt is a starting point for defining the QDA code system, i.e. simple regular hierarchy (taxonomy) of terms (codes, in QDA parlance). Typically, the main entity class names (the ones that define will become top-level codes in the hierarchy, and then subclass names *as well as* types become subcodes). The challenge here is to capture at top level the significant facets from entities in the domain, and to capture also relationships (e.g. with goals and motives) that may be hidden way down in the specialisation hierarchy.\nIt is the reference model to construct a schema for the (graph) database that we want to create using Neo4J, to export and further process the coded-annotated data from MaxQDA. The main consideration for this is twofold:\n\nFirstly, what kind of expressiveness can we expect from the coded qualitative data, i.e. what kinds of relationships between, say, Actors, Activities etc. will be retrievable from the (multiple) codings of segments of data so that we can export them in an Excel spreadsheet and import them to generate automatically graph data within Neo4J? We can use complex code searches for this, e.g. find the (overlapping, identical, contiguous) segments that are coded both with a specific code (and its subcodes) and another code (and its subcodes) and surmise that the two are linked through a relationship in the conceptual model. Some experimentation with a coded paragraph of text, examining the resulting xls output, may be helpful to determine the possibilities. One idea is to define a \"container\" code, e.g. \"Context\", which we can use to highlight/code a continuous longer segment of text that refers to the same activity, or topic, in a participant's interview, and then seek to just create an output xls with codes from different code facets/hierarchies, e.g. actors (people and collectivities), activities, archaeological entities, tools etc. that belong to each such context, and then recreate separate graphs for each individual context by imputing relationships between entities postulated by our conceptual model.\nSecondly, what kinds of questions/queries we envisage interrogating the database with? These should be derived from our interest in substantive questions within E-CURATORS, on the structure of digitally-mediated / archaeology-related activities people engage with, on the identities motivations, and affiliations of people, on the goals stated for specific things they do, on the use of methods, routines, procedural knowledge etc. in accomplishing specific tasks, on the use and role of particular digital technologies, devices, tools, online infrastructures etc., on the problems and issues encountered by people, and the ways, ideas, approaches, solutions they are considering or employing in their activity, etc. But each dataset (from different E-CURATORS case study) may present us with further yet unanticipated dimensions. What we know already is more or less captured in texts already circulated within our workspace so far, and remains at a general, hopefully shared across cases, level, and a useful approach would be to scan ADS interviews and reverse-engineer a set of queries that are implicit in the material (i.e. questions that this evidence attends to), and, then, subset entities, relationships and properties from the conceptual model into Neo4J property lists/schemas for individual kinds of objects, which will then be used to convert MaxQDA outputs in .xls into graph database structures.\n\n\nSpecific comments and questions from the April 15, 2019 workshop\n\nPerhaps we don’t need SI Observable Entity — in general, much of that expansion of CIDOC CRM is relevant really to scientific instrumentation data processing which is rather irrelevant in our case (we may enocunter cases where people talk about capturing digital data, but will not process such data in our study).\nDo we need Creation and Assignment as subclasses of Activity? Activities can implicate objects in different relationships, and from our point of view it is important to differentiate between the relationship to a (direct) object and that to a means / tool that contributes to the activity, and for the \"input\" and \"output\" of an activity - so the Creation vs. Assignment subclasses differentiate between activities that point to an entire object (and one could think also of Destruction as a relevant complement to Creation) and those that modify an object through changing one or more of its properties (where apart from knowledge-related changes we should also consider physical modification of the Object as long as it retains its identity). The question is: do de need subclasses here, or would it be adequate to just note Activity types that would include Creation, Modification, Destruction etc.?\nWe need surely a specialisation of Activity for Assignments (Assertions) - to use the CRMinf notion. What people assert in general can be traced through kinds of Conceptual objects (e.g. Propositional Objects, Statements), the question of subclassing Activities (rather than just using Activity types) boils down to whether we need the additional properties to reconstitute what is assigned, the property it concerns etc.\nThe subclasses of Assignment, Argumentation, Belief adoption, Inference making, Evaluation, Simulation/prediction, Hypothesis building could be interesting and useful to be converted into QDA codes\n\nthe same things in SO are represented as Statements which are kinds of Conceptual objects; do we need to account for the activity of, say, evaluating, so that we recover in the Neo4J database the relationship of what is the thing that is evaluated, who evaluated it etc.? Or is it enough to just note evaluating as an activity type?\n\n\nNote: assuming that we seek to \"code\" kinds of activities such as evaluating, stating a hypothesis etc., we should consider how we could extract automatically the relationships of such an activity from QDA codings. One option would be to replicate in the code system (and codings) the kinds of conceptual objects that are the output of each the Argumentation subclasses, e.g. Evaluative statement, Hypothesis. Then we could create a query to find collocations between Argumentation (and subcodes) and Statement (and subcodes), and reconstitute the relationship in graphs within Neo4J.\nNote: Goals are kinds of statements, methods as kinds of conceptual objects - what they are *for the activity* is expressed as properties of the relationships\nMore specific decisions/considerations will emerge as we talk about the provisional code system we are building for Qualitative Data Analysis, have some experience using it, and consolidate decisions on it."

Association with a domain also entails embodied experiences that are somewhat tangential to the actual practices that characterize the domain. Membership is expressed by adorning symbols, wearing certain styles of clothing, using certain styles of language and means of communication, association with certain domain-specific tools or objects in social or non-work contexts, or participation in shared memory or nostalgia. The expectation to perform membership in these ways has implications regarding the domains’ openness to diversity, since certain expressions used to signify belonging may be strongly associated with broader societal norms pertaining to particular subsets of the population, and those individuals would be able to enact these behaviours more easily or in ways that are deemed more genuine (Huggett 2004)."

For Knorr-Cetina, knowledge objects are like well-organized drawers in a filing cabinet. In contrast, gaps in knowledge or unexpected behaviour are characterized as untidy and incomplete drawers that exist in an unresolved state. For Knorr-Cetina, science is an endeavour focusing on deriving a coherent understanding of the world, which involves the use of already established knowledge objects in the validation of newly arrived at ideas. However, my notion of knowledge differs from this in that it is not necessarily useful in a utilitarian sense. Instead, it refers to the ‘thick’ substrate that new knowledge must be compatible with. It is the context within which archaeological activities are undertaken, which inform and motivate them.\nLegitimate knowledge is grounded and recognized by methodological rigour (i.e. the appropriateness and integrity of methods and data, see below), and therefore differs from Latour and Woolgar’s (1986) characterization of “facts” as detached from the contexts from which they are derived."

    "text": "Situated cognition\nSituated cognition examines the improvised, contingent and embodied experiences of human activity. It prioritizes emphasis on subjects’ outlooks, which are contextualized by their prior experiences. In this sense, situated cognition is closely related to Lave and Wenger’s theory of situated learning (also commonly referred to as a ‘communities of practice’ approach), which examines how individuals acquire professional skills in relation to their social environments (Lave and Wenger 1991). Situated cognition lends itself to investigating rather fluid, open-ended and affect-oriented actions, and is geared towards understanding how actors draw from their prior experiences to navigate through unique situations. It may be applied to examine how people who are learning new skills learn how to work in new ways relative to what they are used to. In such situations, situated cognition enables observers to examine how people align their perspectives as work progresses, and to better understand how people’s general outlooks may have changed with the guidance of more experienced mentors.\nLave and Wenger (1991) Suchman (2007)"

Databases are generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. While tech-savvy people typically limit their definition of a database to implementations of database management systems (DBMS) designed from a computationally-technical perspective, it is common for archaeologists to treat collections of discrete spreadsheets, which tend to be more user-friendly for less technical users, in ways that correspond with the definition provided above. Relational databases, which are commonly employed to manage archaeological data collected by a particular project, relate heterogeneous datasets by aligning them against mutual reference keys. Databases are also sometimes referred to as archives, typically when referring to the preservation of their contents for posterity. The term archive is also commonly used to refer to collections of physical records, which are often kept after being transcribed into digital formats."
