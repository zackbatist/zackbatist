Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK) Examine archaeological research as cultural practice, or as ways of understanding the world through a complex series of physical and conceptual interactions between humans and the objects that captivate their interests (Pickering 1992). Knowledge is not created in a vacuum; it is derived from prior knowledge and experiences that are deemed relevant to particular topics of research interest.
